Reviewer 1 - Referee report: AJAE MS 19030, “Information and communication
 technologies (ICTs) to provide agricultural advice to smallholder farmers:
 Experimental evidence from Uganda.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper presents the results of an RCT designed to measure the impact
 of agricultural extension information for smallholder maize farmers in
 eastern Uganda provided in three ways using ICT: (i) informational videos
 shown to farmers (in-person on a tablet, twice), (ii) an invitation to
 an IVR-based information hotline that farmers could call on demand, and
 (iii) reminder SMS messages about agricultural practices and the hotline.
 The intervention was incremental---other than a pure control group, treated
 farmers received (i), (i) and (ii), or (i), (ii), and (iii) (i.e.
 no farmers received an invitation to the IVR-based hotline without also
 seeing the videos).
 The authors find that farmers retain the new information provided to them
 in the videos and that they change their behavior accordingly, leading
 to an increase in yields of 10 percent.
 They find no increased impact of inviting farmers to the IVR-based hotline
 nor of the reminder SMS messages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps the greatest strength of this study is the care which the authors
 put into what information was provided to farmers and when.
 This is evident in the description of the process by which the authors
 determined what information to provide farmers and how to package it.
 It is no surprise to me given this care that the information was valuable
 and that farmers absorbed it and some acted on it.
 As such, I believe this paper presents a clear contribution in how agricultural
 extension information provision, if done carefully, can have an impact.
 This is especially important given how split the literature is on the possible
 impacts of information provision for farmers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the same time, perhaps the two greatest weaknesses of this study are
 both features of the design that are fixed---the incremental design rather
 than a true test of supply-driven versus demand-driven information and
 the short-term nature of the outcomes.
 In the former case, the authors (I believe rightfully) highlight the tension
 between supply-driven information provision (experts deciding what information
 farmers would benefit from and giving it to them) and demand-driven (making
 information available but letting farmers seek out what information they
 want when they want it).
 But then the incremental design of the study prohibits the authors from
 actually testing supply- vs demand-driven information provision in a meaningful
 way.
 The challenge with the short-term nature of the outcomes is that the authors
 find increased yield per acre of land for treated farmers relative to control
 but no increase in total maize output and, at the same time, changes in
 inputs.
 We are left not knowing if households are actually better off in the short
 term, or even better off in the sense that they may have made changes that
 come at a cost in the short-term but are worthwhile in the medium-/long-term.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While these two weaknesses are fixed, I believe the authors can better address
 them:

1.
 While the paper is very clear that only incremental impacts are being measured
 of the second and third intervention, I still find the supply- versus demand-dr
iven framing to be misleading.
 This is especially the case given the very low take-up of the IVR-based
 hotline.
 I would remove it from front-and-center (i.e.
 the intro and research aim sections) and instead discuss this tension and
 exactly what this study is able to tell us about supply versus demand in
 a short section at the end of the results, or in the conclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We agree that putting this front-and-center can create the expectation that
 we are going to implement a horse race type experiment instead of the increment
al design we use.
 We now present the intervention more as an extension package with different
 components.
 We have followed the suggestion and have deferred the discussion on the
 different characteristics the components of the intervention to the end
 of the paper.
 The demand driven nature of the IVR is mentioned in the context of the
 low take-up, which in turn may explain the null results for the incremental
 IVR effect.
 Other reviewers also take issue with the supply- versus demand-framing,
 and especially the fact that we use this to

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Different information technologies have different characteristics, making
 their effectiveness highly context specific.
 This may help explain why some components of our design seem to be effective
 for particular outcomes, while others are not.
 For instance, to introduce a new agronomic practice or technology (such
 as plant spacing of 75cm x 30cm with a reduced seed rate of 1 seed per
 hill), showing a video may be more effective than a demand-driven technology
 such as a hot-line, where farmers are assumed to be aware of their information
 needs.
 At the same time, a video shown on a tablet computer is generally a one-off
 intervention, and particular details such as the exact name and dose of
 a new type of seed may be missed or easily forgotten by farmers.
 Access to a demand driven information technology such as a hot-line may
 thus be more effective if agronomic practices are complex or require precise
 implementation.
 However, if there is no demand for such a technology (or take-up is constrained
 by other factors), information is also not disseminated.
 SMS messages are often framed as a supply-driven behavioral

 designed to remind people to make decisions or take actions toward some
 particular objective.
 Timely reminders have often been found very effective in overcoming inertia,
 procrastination, competing obligations, or simple forgetfulness of human
 beings

.
 However, SMS messages are short, which may be a problem when complex informatio
n needs to be disseminated.
 Farmers also need to be literate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 On the short-term nature of the outcomes measured, I think that the paper
 would benefit from a direct discussion of the potential costs and benefits
 of the changes that farmers make in response to treatment.
 Does the recommended planting spacing take the same time or more or less
 in terms of farm labor? And how labor-costly is increased weeding and pest
 control? And the authors should be able to back-of-the-envelope prices
 of different fertilizer and seed inputs and give us a sense of whether
 farmers are investing more as a result of the changes that they are making.
 And if we assume they in the next planting season use all of their land
 with a 10% higher yield, would they be better off? Put another way, if
 farmers are actually spending the same amount on inputs (including labor)
 but are changing to a more productive mix, they would necessarily be better
 off and that should be a highlight of the paper.

This comment is related to the first comment made by reviewers 3 and 4 (R3.12,
 R4.1), who, in addition to a cost-benefit analysis at the level of the farmer,
 also wants to see a cost-benefit analysis for the entire project (i.e.
 is this a reasonable policy intervention).
 As 3 reviewers agree that a cost-benefit analysis would be a major improvement
 to the manuscript, we opted to add a separate section in which we first
 check if the video intervention affected profitability of the average farmer
 and then compare the total cost of the intervention to the total benefit
 derived by the farmers in our study.

While we did not collect detailed information on prices paid for inputs
 or wages.
 However, we can use the estimates above together with aggregate price data
 and some assumptions in a series of back-of-the-envelope cost and benefit
 calculations.
 We first check if the video intervention affected profitability of the
 average farmer and then compare the total cost of the intervention to the
 total benefit derived by the farmers in our study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
In our sample, a bag of 100 110 kg of maize was sold at a median price of
 UGX 60,000.
 We have seen that a control household reported yields of 430 kg per acre,
 with a corresponding value of UGX 258,000.
 In the sub-sample that received the video treatment, yields increase to
 474 kg per acre, corresponding to UGX 283,800.
 This means a difference in income of UGX 26,400 per acre, or about 7.5 USD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
From this, we subtract the cost of inputs.
 We recommended two hybrid seed, Longe 10H and UH5354 (commonly known as
 Bazooka).
 At the time of the experiment, Longe 10H sold for UGX 6,000 per kg, while
 Bazooka costed UGX 8,500 per kg.
 However, the data shows that the use of Bazooka was marginal and not correlated
 to the treatment.
 We will therefor use only the price of Longe 10H in the cost calculations.
 We further recommended two open-pollinated varieties Longe 5 and Longe
 4.
 Among these two, Longe 5 is the most common variety.
 Both types costed about UGX 3,000 per kg.
 A farmer needs about 8 kg of seed to plant one acre.
 Inorganic fertilizers are probably the largest cost.
 The retail price of 1 kg of urea was about UGX 2,500, while DAP costed
 UGX 3,000 per kilo.
 We recommended using 60 kg of both DAP and Urea on one acre.
 We assume that organic fertilizer is free, but may increase labour cost
 (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The recommended spacing and seed rate is unlikely to increase costs of seed.
 We recommend a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with one seeds per hill.
 We assume that most farmers would use 75cm x 60cm with two seeds per hill,
 leading to the same amount of seed needed per unit of land.
 We thus simply multiply the cost of these inputs by the likelihood that
 they are applied in both control and treatment group (Table 3) and subtract
 this from the income obtained from maize.
 Doing so actually increases the difference in income between treatment
 and control somewhat, as the likelihood that farmers use the more expensive
 fertilizer DAP reduced somewhat, while the likelihood that farmers use
 Urea increased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Changes in the cost of labour are harder to value.
 Table 2 shows an increase in the practice of removing stirga early on,
 which is likely to increase labour.
 The new spacing recommendation also means more hills are needed, which
 may also have an impact on labour, as does the increased use of organic
 fertilizer.
 At the same time, we do not find that the video treatment is significantly
 correlated to the time spent on preparing the land (which includes application
 of inorganic fertilizer), to time spend on weeding, nor to the likelihood
 that labor is hired in.
 In addition, labour is very cheap at only 6,000 per day.
 Valuing work related to organic fertilizer adoption at 3 days, the adoption
 of the new planting method at 2 days and the work for weeding at 10 days
 (which is the time needed to weed one acre), the difference reduces to
 22,308 or about 6.4 USD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The intervention overall costed close to USD 37,000.
 Almost 40 percent of this are fixed costs such as the production of the
 video (USD 6,300) and the cost of procuring 20 tablets at a total cost
 of USD 5,600.
 We also needed to train the enumerators at a total cost of 2,224.
 Variable costs are estimated to be about USD 2.77 for a single screening
 to an average farmer in the area.
 This includes time for the personnel showing the video and supervision
 time, car hire with driver, and fuel needed to reach the households.
 As a result, the intervention as implemented would only break even at about
 7,000 observations.
 If the intervention is rolled out to all 360,000 households in the 5 districts
 where the intervention was piloted, the internal rate of return would be
 about 34 %
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
It may be possible to reduce variable costs considerable.
 The largest component of the variable cost is the wage of of the person
 showing the videos to individual households.
 Currently, an extension worker with a bachelor's degree costs about the
 same of what we paid our enumerators.
 One may argue that one does not need to have a university degree to show
 a video, in which case extension workers with only a diploma an be used
 at roughly USD 77,000 per day.
 This would bring the variable cost down to about USD 2.36 for a single screening
 for the average farmer.
 Other cost savings may be obtained by showing videos to groups of farmers
 instead of individually, or direct streaming of videos to devices of farmers.
 However, this touches upon potentially important design features of the
 intervention than may alter outcomes, and as such require additional testing.

3.
 I think it is too late to first mention the poor take-up of the IVR-based
 hotline on page 12.
 I think that it should be highlighted from the intro and on as a potential
 reason for the lack of impacts.
 Relatedly, I think that the empirical results on the IVR-system take-up
 and SMS message receipt should be presented, including both the LATE results
 themselves and regressions of take-up on farmer characteristics to help
 interpret selection into take-up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reviewer 2 (R2.2) also suggests a more in-depth discussion of the LATE-results.
 This reviewer's main concern is related to potential contamination of the
 control group to explain the lack of impact found for the IVR.
 Also reviewer 3 suggests that the lack of impact of IVR as assessed by
 the ITT may be due to the low take up (R3.9).
 The original submission of this manuscript was accompanied by a pdf document
 entitled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 of materials we would have liked to make available in on-line appendices.
 It included the 2SLS (LATE) regressions.
 Apparently, this was not available to the reviewers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We appreciate the suggestions by the reviewers and now discuss the low takeup
 of the IVR intervention earlier in the paper.
 In a section entitled additional analysis, explain that farmers self select
 into the IVR treatment and that also SMS reception is not universal.
 We then present regressions that show how uptake/message reception is correlate
d to baseline characteristics.
 We discuss LATE effects briefly, and refer to tables in the appendix for
 completeness.
 We note that results do not change all that much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We then reflect on potential reasons for the lack of impact.
 We look at take up/message reception and using simple back of the envelope
 calculations show the minimum detectable effect size and how it is affected
 by low compliance.
 We then argue that contamination is unlikely to lead to a downward bias,
 as only 1 percent of households in the control group called the IVR.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We then discuss a particular concern with our measure of compliance.
 In particular, we suspect that LATE in our context would overestimate the
 impact of the IVR.
 The reason is that our indicator of take up of the intervention is likely
 to be measured with significant error.
 In particular, our indicator of compliance is taken from the IVR system
 log, where recorded telephone numbers are matched to phone numbers that
 were recorded during baseline data collection.
 This indicator is likely to severely under-report true compliance, as encourage
d farmers may use different phones to call the IVR.
 This is illustrated by the fact that about 430 unique calls were made to
 the system, representing about 18 percent of encouraged households, hence
 almost doubling compliance.
 Using our measure of compliance, we can not maintain that the independence
 assumption holds, as some of the potential outcomes are directly determined
 by the instrument.
 The problem becomes clear when we think about LATE as the Wald estimator
 that scales the ITT by compliance.
 In our case, the ITT will be estimated on the basis of all 430 farmers
 that called in.
 Our measure of compliance will force all the impact of the treatment to
 work through the 214 households that show up in the IVR log and could be
 identified in the baseline, which in the case of a positive impact would
 lead to an overestimate of the impact of the treatment on compliers.
 It is well know that especially in the context of a weak first stage the
 bias can become extremely large 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 We thus conclude that LATE results are difficult to interpret and suggest
 to focus on the ITT effects.

 It would be very helpful to better understand the population of study in
 this paper relative to those studied in similar interventions (i.e.
 representativeness to other populations in Africa, and even South Asia
 and/or Latin America) and the result of this paper relative to other results
 in terms of magnitudes.
 The paper says “the use of modern inputs...is very low in Uganda” and “Maize
 is especially important in eastern Uganda,” for example.
 Both of these comments could be backed with data.
 Similarly, while I believe the sampling was done correctly, the UNHS could
 be used to empirically show how representative the finally selected HHs
 are relative to Uganda as a whole, etc.

 Relatedly, given how well it sounds this intervention was implemented,
 I believe the paper would benefit from a brief discussion of the representative
ness of the implementation and implementing partner(s).
 Who were the “trained field enumerators” and how do they compare to average
 extension workers (i.e.
 could this intervention realistically be scaled with a government or a
 medium-capacity non-profit)? And how established is Viamo in Uganda? I
 believe establishing external validity in terms of both the population
 being studied and the implementation of the intervention is necessary to
 ensure this paper’s contribution to a mixed literature.

 I worry about experimenter demand effects quite a bit with these results.
 I would not be worried about this if the endline enumerators observed plots
 (especially spacing) and/or collected detailed information about new products
 that were purchased (where from? Could such be verified?).
 It may be none of this was feasible but it warrants a discussion.

The dangers of using self-reported survey data to measure key outcomes is
 a concern that was also echoed by all other reviewers (R2.5, R3.7 an R4.7).
 We thus added a separate section that discusses experimenter demand effects:

A key concern with our study is the fact that we use self-reported survey
 data on key outcomes, as opposed to outcomes that are measured by a third
 party in an objective way.
 Study participants may report what they feel is desired in that context
 (social desirability bias).
 In an RCT, social desirability bias becomes a real concern if it is correlated
 to the treatment, which is sometimes referred to as experimenter demand
 effects

 less problematic than initially thought 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

before "eg."
key "de2018measuring,mummolo2019demand"

\end_inset

, we provide some discussion on why we feel experimenter demand effects
 are unlikely to drive our results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
First, during the design of the endline questionnaire, we tried to minimize
 potential experimenter demand effects by careful formulation of the questions.
 Experimenter demand effects are more likely to be a concern for simple
 yes/no questions than for more open ended questions.
 For instance, in our endline survey, we did not ask if farmers used 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plant spacing of 75cm x 30cm with a reduced seed rate of 1 seed per hill
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as recommended.
 Rather, we asked farmers to describe the planting process, and the enumerator
 was then asked to select the appropriate response from a list of options
 that was not revealed to the farmer.
 For input adoption, we started from broad questions (eg.
 whether fertilizer was used on a particular plot) and then asked farmers
 to go further into detail (eg.
 asking about fertilizer type, timing of application, quantities and price)
 allowing enumerators to detect inconsistencies that may signal experimenter
 demand effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Second, in our endline survey, not all outcomes are equally likely to be
 affected by experimenter demand effects.
 For instance, experimenter demand effects are probably less likely to be
 an issue for the multiple choice questions used to measure knowledge than
 for questions about implementation of recommended practices or the use
 of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer or improved seed.
 It is reassuring that there is consistency between effects found on questions
 that are more or less prone to experimenter demand effect.
 In other words, if we would have found that our interventions did not result
 in a change in knowledge related to optimal plant spacing, yet farmers
 report that they did use optimal plant spacing on their plots, we would
 be more worried that the latter effect was driven by experimenter demand
 effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Third, as we will report in the next section, fertilizer adoption, an outcome
 prone to experimenter demand effects, seems to increase particularly for
 treated farmers that live close to an agro-input dealer.
 This finding reduces the possibility that results are driven by misreporting
 related to experimenter demand effects, as this would mean that households
 that have better access to improved inputs strategically decide to report
 their answers differently than households that have less access to inputs.

I also have several additional minor comments:

Maize is especially important in eastern Uganda.
 We sampled from five districts in eastern Uganda known for their maize
 production: Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo, and Namutumba.
 From this, we removed from our sample town councils and also two sub-counties
 that consisted of islands in lake Victoria.
 We used two-stage cluster sampling to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, from the five districts, we first selected 50 parishes randomly
 and in proportion to the number of villages within each parish.
 Within each village in the selected parishes, we then listed all households,
 from which we randomly selected 10 households to participate in the study.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
In each village, one of the 10 households was randomly allocated to the
 control group (which got to see a placebo video).
 The remaining 9 households were all shown a video.
 As mentioned in footnote 1, this research was part of a larger research
 project that also used the video intervention to explore issues related
 to gender in agricultural extension.
 Because of this, we also experimentally varied who provided the information
 in the video (a man alone, a woman alone, or a couple (man+woman)) as well
 as to whom the video was shown within the household (a man alone, a woman
 alone, or a couple (man+woman)).
 In the context of a factorial design with two factors and each 3 levels,
 this corresponded to 9 treatment combinations.
 We thus used the village as blocs, and randomly assigned the nine potential
 treatment combinations to the remaining 9 households in each village.
 We then added the IVR treatment randomly to 2/3 of the households in each
 treatment cell.
 For example, from the 385 households where the man within the household
 would be shown a video where a man provides all the information, 257 randomly
 selected households were also provided with the encouragement to use the
 IVR.
 Among those that were allocated the IVR in each treatment cell, we then

 For instance, from the 257 households where the man would be shown a video
 featuring a man and who also were allocated to receive the IVR treatment,
 128 where randomly allocated to also receive the SMS reminders.
 As such, the treatment cells created by the interaction of the 2 other
 factors were used as blocs in the randomization of IVR and SMS treatments.
 The exact same sampling procedure was used in the permutation algorithm
 that was used to judge significance through randomization inference.

 I think that any outcome that was collected at the individual level should
 be analyzed at the individual level, or at least appendix tables should
 present individual-level results.
 Taking a household-level maximum makes some intuitive sense but is a very

R2 - Review of “ICTs to Provide Agricultural Advice to Smallholder Farmers:
 Experimental Evidence from Uganda” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Summary: The paper investigates the potential of Information and Communication
 Technologies (ICTs) for agricultural extension.
 In particular, the authors test whether alternative ICTs can enhance farmers’
 knowledge of improved practices, increase the adoption of such practices,
 and improve yields.
 They set up a field experiment where a random group of farmers was assigned
 to a treatment group which received access to a video (screened on a tablet
 by an enumerator) with agricultural advice.
 Farmers in the treatment group were further split into two groups: one
 was part of an encouragement design to use an interactive voice response
 (IVR) technology and the other one was not.
 The encouragement design promoted farmers’ access to on-demand pre-recorded
 messages on their phones with the same agricultural advices as the video
 intervention.
 Additionally, a randomly selected subgroup of those in the encouragement
 group were assigned to receive eight text messages around the time of some
 important agricultural practices related to the overall extension campaign.
 This design allows the authors to test: (a) the impact of the video extension
 program, (b) the incremental effect of the IVR system, and (c) the additional
 impact of the text message reminders.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, they find that the video intervention increased farmers’ knowledge
 of practices, improved the likelihood of adopting recommended practices,
 and raised yields.
 However, they find that the IVR and text message components generated little
 further improvements in these outcomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
General Comment: I enjoyed reading the paper and believe it makes a useful
 contribution to the emerging literature on the role of ICTs in agricultural
 extension.
 In my view, its biggest contribution is testing the joint effectiveness
 of different types of ICTs (when most the available work focuses only on
 one).
 Methodologically, the authors are able to estimate causal estimates based
 on randomized assignment.
 They are also rigorous in their inference by using increasingly popular
 techniques (based on randomization inference and adjusting for family-wise
 error rates).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suggestions: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 The paper is based on a traditional theory of change for agricultural extension
: extension leads to improvements of knowledge, which increases adoption
 of improved practices and subsequently boosts yields.
 Along this line, the paper would benefit from better translating this theory
 of change into their outcomes.
 For example, the paper’s outcomes for knowledge are plant spacing, input
 combination, timing of weeding, and fall armyworm control.
 While they do include some of these concepts in their adoption outcomes
 (i.e., spacing and weeding), there are several others — timing of planting,
 management of striga (though somewhat related 1to weeding), fertilizer
 use, and seed choices — for which there no measures of knowledge gains.
 Including outcomes related to the same practices in their analysis of adoption
 and knowledge would lend more credibility to the mechanisms through which
 ICT-based extension improves farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The way the results are presented in the manuscript may suggest that we
 had a traditional theory of change in mind, where a lack of technical knowledge
 is the main constraint to increased modern input use or application of
 recommended practices.
 However, we were aware of an emerging body of research that also explores
 alternative impact pathways, and our research was also informed by this.
 For instance, our videos use actors that farmers can relate to, drawing
 on an emerging literature on the importance of peer learning, the effectiveness
 of model farmers in inspiring others 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "benyishay2018social,doi:10.1093/wber/lhv014"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, our video not only demonstrates the use of new inputs and
 the application of recommended practices.
 It also contains parts that draw on studies that shown how behavioural
 change communication and social marketing can be used to change behavour
 and practices that are deeply entranced in traditional agricultural societies.
 Therefore, assessing changes in knowledge was subordinate to assessing
 changes in behaviour and production and we opted to measure knowledge on
 four topics using 4 multiple choice questions.
 However, these four questions were carefully though about.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
One questions was on spacing.
 The recommendation we provided in the video was a new way of spacing with
 reduced seeding rate that was only recently being promoted by the government
 (spacing of 75cm x 30cm with 1 plant per hill).
 As this was new, we expected to find only few people in the control group
 would know this and that the intervention would significantly increase
 this knowledge.
 This, in turn, we hoped would increase the actual application of the new
 way of spacing.
 As such, this follows a traditional theory of change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The second question that was included is not so much about testing technical
 knowledge.
 It is more about testing if farmers understood the broader message given
 in the video that successful farmers generally see maize farming more as
 a business than as a means to provide food for the household.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The third question was included to investigate how video can be used to
 make a known technology more salient.
 We knew from previous work in the region and from qualitative interviews
 that farmers are generally well aware about the optimal timing for first
 weeding, but few farmers actually do it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The last questions was added to see if our information interventions would
 crowd in additional search for information.
 We did not provide any information about fall armyworm in our videos, IVR
 nor SMS messages.
 We thus also did not expect our interventions to have a direct effect on
 knowledge related to fighting fall armyworm.
 However, it could be that farmers that received information on recommended
 practices and modern inputs and shown life stories of successful farmers
 start to look for information from various other sources.
 As fall armyworm was an important emerging problem at the time, we thought
 this would be a good topic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Changes made to the text: In the part where the intervention is described,
 we already state clearly that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not all constraints to maize productivity improvement are information deficienci
es directly related to the use of inputs, technologies, and crop management
 practices.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, so we did not think it necessary to further explain that we do not only
 consider a traditional theory of change.
 However, when explaining the knowledge questions, we now explain better
 why the question was included by referring to the potential impact pathway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 The paper would benefit from clarification of the research design.
 In particular, it would be useful to better understand why — in contrast
 to most recent field experiments on agricultural extension — the randomization
 was conducted at the individual rather than the village level.
 Information can flow easily between subjects and create externalities.
 While cluster randomization does not eliminate contamination of the control
 group, it reduces (inasmuch as possible) this flow of information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
As mentioned in footnote 1, this research was part of a larger research
 project that also used the video intervention to explore issues related
 to gender in agricultural extension.
 The full design needed to be balanced across 30 treatment combinations,
 which was hard to achieve using cluster randomization.
 We thus decided to randomize at the individual level, despite the risk
 that the controls also benefit from the treatment (making it harder to
 detect a significant difference if there is an effect).
 The research design is now much better explained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Changes made to the text: We have added the following to the Experimental
 Design and Estimation of Treatment Effect section:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We sampled from five districts in eastern Uganda known for their maize productio
n: Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo, and Namutumba.
 From this, we removed from our sample town councils and also two sub-counties
 that consisted of islands in lake Victoria.
 We used two-stage cluster sampling to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, from the five districts, we first selected 50 parishes randomly
 and in proportion to the number of villages within each parish.
 Within each village in the selected parishes, we then listed all households,
 from which we randomly selected 10 households to participate in the study.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
In each village, one of the 10 households was randomly allocated to the
 control group (which got to see a placebo video).
 The remaining 9 households were all shown a video.
 As mentioned in footnote 1, this research was part of a larger research
 project that also used the video intervention to explore issues related
 to gender in agricultural extension.
 Because of this, we also experimentally varied who provided the information
 in the video (a man alone, a woman alone, or a couple (man+woman)) as well
 as to whom the video was shown within the household (a man alone, a woman
 alone, or a couple (man+woman)).
 In the context of a factorial design with two factors and each 3 levels,
 this corresponded to 9 treatment combinations.
 We thus used the village as blocs, and randomly assigned the nine potential
 treatment combinations to the remaining 9 households in each village.
 We then added the IVR treatment randomly to 2/3 of the households in each
 treatment cell.
 For example, from the 385 households where the man within the household
 would be shown a video where a man provides all the information, 257 randomly
 selected households were also provided with the encouragement to use the
 IVR.
 Among those that were allocated the IVR in each treatment cell, we then
 randomly allocated half of the households to the SMS treatment.
 For instance, from the 257 households where the man would be shown a video
 featuring a man and who also were allocated to receive the IVR treatment,
 128 where randomly allocated to also receive the SMS reminders.
 As such, the treatment cells created by the interaction of the 2 other
 factors were used as blocs in the randomization of IVR and SMS treatments.
 The exact same sampling procedure was used in the permutation algorithm
 that was used to judge significance through randomization inference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The authors find considerable impacts of their video intervention (especially
 for plant spacing), but no additional effects of the other ICTs (such as
 IVR).
 The IVR encouragement design was conducted through randomly providing some
 farmers with flyers incentivizing them to call a toll-free number and get
 agricultural information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can always argue that — if there are flows of information from the video
 to the control group — this would provide an underestimate of the treatment
 effect (given that it is already sizable and positive).
 But, the randomization strategy by itself may have a role to play in the
 IVR effect.
 Those with access to the extension videos may have shared the toll-free
 number with others.
 Because the video and IVR information have complementary effects (as implicitly
 assumed in the setup of the field experiment), those with information about
 the toll free number are more likely to have shared it with others that
 also had been in a video screening session.
 This would generate a downward bias of the treatment effect (which might
 be truly positive) of the IVR (consistent with the findings of the paper).
 Furthermore, text- message intervention was nested within the IVR encouragement
 design, this contamination can also downward bias the estimates of the
 text message campaign.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One potential way to address this is to use the random assignment to the
 IVR as an instrument for actually calling the toll free number.
 The authors do account for this possibility in the paper.
 However, the results are not shown, and the paper might benefit from presenting
 them.
 The authors find there were 430 unique calls, out of which 214 corresponded
 to phone numbers in the encouragement group (about 9% of the encouraged
 households).
 It is unclear how many of these unique calls could be traced to individuals
 in the experiment that were not part of this encouragement group.
 This could provide an idea of any contamination of the control group that
 could lead the ITT estimate downwards.
 It would also tell us how strong the first is and whether the instrument
 is relevant enough for an IV estimation.
 Additionally, the take-up in the encouraged group (9%) would suggest that
 the IV-treatment effect would correspond to the Intent-to-treat (ITT) scaled-up
 by a factor of 11 (potentially larger once we account for any potential
 take-up in the control group).
 This could lead to a different interpretation of the results if the IV
 estimates are large (even when not statistically significant).
 This information would help us better understand the IVR (and potentially
 the text message) results of the paper.
 Is it that the ITT is low due to contamination? Can we conclude that there
 are no effects of IVR? Are these effects sizable, but imprecise? Or should
 we just conclude that the demand was low (and there is not much more to
 say about this)?

We appreciate the suggestions by the reviewers and now discuss the low takeup
 of the IVR intervention earlier in the paper.
 In a section entitled additional analysis, we explain that farmers self
 select into the IVR treatment and that also SMS reception is not universal.
 We then present regressions that show how uptake/message reception is correlate
d to baseline characteristics.
 We discuss LATE effects briefly, and refer to tables in the appendix for
 completeness.
 We note that results do not change all that much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We then reflect on potential reasons for the lack of impact.
 We look at take up/message reception and using simple back of the envelope
 calculations show the minimum detectable effect size and how it is affected
 by low compliance.
 We then argue that contamination is unlikely to lead to a downward bias,
 as only 1 percent of households in the control group called the IVR.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We then discuss a particular concern with our measure of compliance.
 In particular, we suspect that LATE in our context would overestimate the
 impact of the IVR.
 The reason is that our indicator of take up of the intervention is likely
 to be measured with significant error.
 In particular, our indicator of compliance is taken from the IVR system
 log, where recorded telephone numbers are matched to phone numbers that
 were recorded during baseline data collection.
 This indicator is likely to severely under-report true compliance, as encourage
d farmers may use different phones to call the IVR.
 This is illustrated by the fact that about 430 unique calls were made to
 the system, representing about 18 percent of encouraged households, hence
 almost doubling compliance.
 Using our measure of compliance, we can not maintain that the independence
 assumption holds, as some of the potential outcomes are directly determined
 by the instrument.
 The problem becomes clear when we think about LATE as the Wald estimator
 that scales the ITT by compliance.
 In our case, the ITT will be estimated on the basis of all 430 farmers
 that called in.
 Our measure of compliance will force all the impact of the treatment to
 work through the 214 households that show up in the IVR log and could be
 identified in the baseline, which in the case of a positive impact would
 lead to an overestimate of the impact of the treatment on compliers.
 It is well know that especially in the context of a weak first stage the
 bias can become extremely large 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 We thus conclude that LATE results are difficult to interpret and suggest
 to focus on the ITT effects.

 The authors report an attrition rate of 7.3%.
 Considering that the intervention only took place over a few months, this
 is quite large.
 While there is no differential attrition between treatment arms (in terms
 of rates and some selected characteristics), the authors could calculate
 bounds (Manski-type, Lee-type, or other) to determine how sensitive their
 estimates are to this problem.

\begin_layout Standard

Baseline data was collected in August 2017, while endline data was collected

 The only outcomes for which the paper finds any impact of the IVR platform
 are the ones related to the adoption of fertilizer (negative effect) and
 improved seeds (large and positive effect).
 Given the other results in the paper, this seems counterintuitive.
 The authors argue that “with access to a more demand-driven ICT channel,
 farmers that used organic fertilizer may seek information on more complex
 but efficient types of fertilizers” (p.26) and that “providing farmers with
 a tool that allows them to actively seek out information about a new input
 or technology increases the likelihood that they also adopt hybrid maize
 seed” (p 27).
 Based on the IVR-dial in codes (e.g., press “1” for recommendations about
 seeds, press “2” for recommendations about fertilizer”, etc.), can the authors
 show that these were topics for which farmers in the encouraged group actively
 demanded? This would lend credibility to the authors’ proposed interpretation
 of their estimates.

 The paper’s results on input adoption are based on self-reported measures
 of input use (e.g., used urea / organic fertilizer / hybrid maize seed /
 open pollinated varieties in at least one plot).
 Is there any possibility to cross check this with other measures of input
 use (such as purchased quantities or expenditures in some inputs)? This
 can lend credibility to the results if we believe that mere report of any
 input use is more subject to social desirability bias than other (less
 direct) measures.
 The authors might also be able to estimate some back-of-the- envelope calculati
ons about plant spacing.
 For example, knowing the size of the area planted for maize and the total
 amount of seeds (improved or not), they could be able to estimate whether
 these quantities are consistent with a 75cm x 30cm spacing recommended
 by the intervention (at least for those who claim that hey followed this
 advice).

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Concerns related to self-reported outcomes and the danger of bias due to
 social desirability or experimenter demand effects have been mentioned
 by all reviewers (R1.6, R3.7,R3.7).
 We considered your suggestion to confirm application of the practice of
 plan spacing by using quantities of seed used.
 However, the default spacing uses virtually the same quantity of seed per
 acre (see also the additional section on cost-effectiveness).
 Still, we added a separate section where we discuss why it is unlikely
 that our analysis is driven by social desirability bias.
 This includes your next suggestion on hetergeneous treatment effect, where
 finding larger impacts for farmers closer to input dealers would make it
 less likely findings are driven by social desirability.

A key concern with our study is the fact that we use self-reported survey

 Study participants may report what they feel is desired in that context
 (social desirability bias).
 In an RCT, social desirability bias becomes a real concern if it is correlated
 to the treatment, which is sometimes referred to as experimenter demand
 effects

 less problematic than initially thought 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "de2018measuring,mummolo2019demand"

\end_inset

, we provide some discussion on why we feel experimenter demand effects
 are unlikely to drive our results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
First, during the design of the endline questionnaire, we tried to minimize
 potential experimenter demand effects by careful formulation of the questions.
 Experimenter demand effects are more likely to be a concern for simple
 yes/no questions than for more open ended questions.
 For instance, in our endline survey, we did not ask if farmers used 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plant spacing of 75cm x 30cm with a reduced seed rate of 1 seed per hill
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as recommended.
 Rather, we asked farmers to describe the planting process, and the enumerator
 was then asked to select the appropriate response from a list of options
 that was not revealed to the farmer.
 For input adoption, we started from broad questions (eg.
 whether fertilizer was used on a particular plot) and then asked farmers
 to go further into detail (eg.
 asking about fertilizer type, timing of application, quantities and price)
 allowing enumerators to detect inconsistencies that may signal experimenter
 demand effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Second, in our endline survey, not all outcomes are equally likely to be
 affected by experimenter demand effects.
 For instance, experimenter demand effects are probably less likely to be
 an issue for the multiple choice questions used to measure knowledge than
 for questions about implementation of recommended practices or the use
 of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer or improved seed.
 It is reassuring that there is consistency between effects found on questions
 that are more or less prone to experimenter demand effect.
 In other words, if we would have found that our interventions did not result
 in a change in knowledge related to optimal plant spacing, yet farmers
 report that they did use optimal plant spacing on their plots, we would
 be more worried that the latter effect was driven by experimenter demand
 effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Third, as we will report in the next section, fertilizer adoption, an outcome
 prone to experimenter demand effects, seems to increase particularly for
 treated farmers that live close to an agro-input dealer.
 This finding reduces the possibility that results are driven by misreporting
 related to experimenter demand effects, as this would mean that households
 that have better access to improved inputs strategically decide to report
 their answers differently than households that have less access to inputs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 The intervention promotes increased input use by aiming to increase farmers’
 demand for improved seeds and fertilizer.
 Demand can indeed increase the use of these inputs, but this effect will
 also depend on their availability or monetary constraints.
 In this line, the authors might want to estimate heterogeneous treatment
 effects of input use by baseline expenditures (or resource constraint proxies,
 if available) and by distance to nearest agro input dealer (included as
 a variable in Table 1).
 The results should, in theory, suggest larger impacts among wealthier household
s and among those closer to agro dealers.
 A finding along these lines would reduce the possibility that paper’s results
 are due to misreporting related to social desirability bias: we would need
 to believe in the unlikely possibility households that are wealthier or
 have better access to improved inputs strategically decide to report their
 answers differentially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
This is an interesting suggestions that is also related to requests for
 a in-depth exploration of heterogeneity in treatment effects (see R4.8).
 We have thus explored this as part of a more general analysis of heterogenous
 treatment effects reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Heterogeneity-in-Treatment"

\end_inset

.
 Results indeed suggest that the positive impact of the video on the use
 of urea is particularly large for farmers that are relatively close to
 an input dealer (defined as less or equal than the median distance in the
 sample, which is 4 km).
 At the same time, and consistent with the theoretical prediction of the
 reviewer, we do not find that the increase in organic fertilizer as a result
 to the video intervention is sensitive to distance to an input provided.
 It was harder to test for heterogenous effects related to baseline resources,
 as we did not collect detailed data on consumption at baseline.
 We tried using different proxies for wealth (such the number of rooms scaled
 by the number of household members, area cultivated, whether the household
 had access to off-farm income,...), but we do not find that effects are different
 between the two groups.
 This may be because the income constraint is not binding - fertilizer can
 usually be obtained in small quantities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Changes made to the text: see above: Third, as we will report in the next
 section, fertilizer adoption, an outcome prone to experimenter demand effects,
 seems to increase particularly for treated farmers that live close to an
 agro-input dealer.
 This finding reduces the possibility that our results are driven by misreportin
g related to experimenter demand effects, as this would mean that households
 that have better access to improved inputs strategically decide to report
 their answers differently than households that have less access to inputs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 The paper suggests that the intervention increased yields: while there
 are no changes in total production, there are reductions in households’
 planted areas.
 The authors attribute this increase in yields to their recommendation to
 “start small” with the use of practices and inputs.
 A significant portion of the effect on knowledge and practices comes from
 recommendations on plant spacing.
 However, there are no increases in the respondents’ perceptions of better
 yields in the treatment group.
 So, another possibility is that, by making space more salient, they might
 have primed households to think more carefully about the total surface
 that they had planted (and this might lead to a reduction in their report
 about their planted areas).
 This would imply that their results would be driven by differential reporting,
 rather than actual increases in yields.
 Can the authors say something about this possibility?

 Based on the text, the campaign’s impact on knowledge is based on short
 quizzes with questions that include four multiple-choice answers.
 However, the examples provided suggest that the number of choices were
 actually three.
 For example, for the question about the timing of weeding the alternatives
 seem to be: “during the first four weeks after planting”, “when the maize
 is knee high” and “when the maize is at tasseling stage”.
 Similar cases occur with the other knowledge questions.

This was also a (minor) comment of reviewer 4 (R4.18).While there is some

 Furthermore, joint balance is never rejected.
 In addition, the imbalance is only for the additional IVR and SMS treatments,
 for which we find little effects.
 As such, imbalance can not be responsible for the impact of the video intervent
ion we find (which would be the biggest concern).
 That said, we have redone the analysis where we now control for the variables
 where imbalances were found.

 The main intervention consists of a video clip on maize farming delivered
 in person.
 The study also evaluates the additional effects of an IVR hotline service
 offering an interactive menu-based information service on the same set
 of agricultural topics, and a series of SMS messages providing the same
 advice timed appropriately throughout the agricultural season.
 Using the survey data, the authors find that the video intervention increased
 relevant agricultural knowledge and the likelihood of adopting recommended
 practices, leading to a 10% increase in maize yield (kg/acre), whereas
 the additional effects of IVR and SMS interventions were insignificant.

\begin_layout Standard
Inadequate information about experimental design – The manuscript lacks
 information on the intervention, experimental design and randomization
 procedure: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 The sample was drawn in three stages – random selection of parishes, villages,
 and then households.
 Was randomization carried out at the individual-level without any stratificatio
n? The estimation model suggests so, but I’d like the authors to confirm
 as it is unusual to have a sample of 4000 households from a large geographic
 area without geographic stratification.

We sampled from five districts in eastern Uganda known for their maize productio
n: Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo, and Namutumba.
 From this, we removed from our sample town councils and also two sub-counties
 that consisted of islands in lake Victoria.
 We used two-stage cluster sampling to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, from the five districts, we first selected 50 parishes randomly
 with the probability of selection in proportion to the number of villages
 within each parish.
 Within each village in the selected parishes, we then listed all households,
 from which we randomly selected 10 households to participate in the study.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 What was the rationale for surveying two people from each household at
 endline? Was the video intervention shown to the couple in each household
 by design? The authors explained that the best response was taken for the
 knowledge outcomes and the means were taken for the production outcomes.
 What about the adoption measures? The gender role in agricultural decision-maki
ng may also inform the optimal way of generating the outcomes.
 If one member in a household tends to be responsible for agricultural decision-
making, his or her responses on knowledge may be more relevant.

 These were all materials we would have liked to make available in on-line

 It included ITT effects conditional on having a mobile phone, the 2SLS
 (LATE) regressions, an anonymized version of the pre-analysis plan, the
 script for the video (scene by scene), a transcript of the content of the
 IVR system (in English, although the farmers also had access to this informatio
n in Lusgoga) and the content of the 8 sms messages, both in Lusoga and
 in English.
 It is unclear if this additional information was also made available to
 the reviewers, and if so, this would have been sufficient.
 We added a copy of the flyer used to invite households to the hotline in
 the additional information (additional_info.pdf).

\begin_layout Standard
Outcomes measures - I have several concerns about how the outcomes were
 selected and constructed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 The selection of measures used for knowledge and recommended practices
 seem somewhat arbitrary.
 For example, the knowledge section includes a question about practices
 on managing fall armyworms, but there is no adoption measure that corresponds
 to this question.
 Similarly, adoption measures include the timing of planning and removing
 striga, but there are no corresponding questions in the knowledge section.
 Do these analyses use all of the relevant questions asked in the survey?
 If yes, how were they selected at the stage of survey development? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
This question is similar to the first concern of reviewer 2 (R2.1).
 Apart from a traditional theory of change, where a lack of technical knowledge
 is the main constraint to increased modern input use or application of
 recommended practices, we also drew from the emerging body of research
 that also explores alternative impact pathways.
 For instance, our videos use actors that farmers can relate to, drawing
 on an emerging literature on the importance of peer learning, the effectiveness
 of model farmers in inspiring others 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "benyishay2018social,doi:10.1093/wber/lhv014"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, our video not only demonstrates the use of new inputs and
 the application of recommended practices.
 It also contains parts that draw on studies that shown how behavioural
 change communication and social marketing can be used to change behavour
 and practices that are deeply entranced in traditional agricultural societies.
 Therefore, as we expected that not all impact necessarily works through
 increasing knowledge, there is no one to one correspondence between knowledge
 questions and technologies and practices.
 However, these four questions were carefully though about.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
One questions was on spacing.
 The recommendation we provided in the video was a new way of spacing with
 reduced seeding rate that was only recently being promoted by the government
 (spacing of 75cm x 30cm with 1 plant per hill).
 As this was new, we expected to find only few people in the control group
 would know this and that the intervention would significantly increase
 this knowledge.
 This, in turn, we hoped would increase the actual application of the new
 way of spacing.
 As such, this follows a traditional theory of change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The second question that was included is not so much about testing technical
 knowledge.
 It is more about testing if farmers understood the broader message given
 in the video that successful farmers generally see maize farming more as
 a business than as a means to provide food for the household.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The third question was included to investigate how video can be used to
 make a known technology more salient.
 We knew from previous work in the region and from qualitative interviews
 that farmers are generally well aware about the optimal timing for first
 weeding, but few farmers actually do it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The last questions was added to see if our information interventions would
 crowd in additional search for information.
 We did not provide any information about fall armyworm in our videos, IVR
 nor SMS messages.
 We thus also did not expect our interventions to have a direct effect on
 knowledge related to fighting fall armyworm.
 However, it could be that farmers that received information on recommended
 practices and modern inputs and shown life stories of successful farmers
 start to look for information from various other sources.
 As fall armyworm was an important emerging problem at the time, we thought
 this would be a good topic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 of the questions are included in the analysis and they were also specified
 in the pre-analysis plan.

5.
 The authors mention in the text that three fertilizers (DAP/NPK, Urea,
 and organic fertilizers) were recommended separately in the video.
 And yet, upon reporting the negative treatment effect on the first fertilizer
 type (DAP/NPK), they decide to create an index that takes non-adoption
 of DAP/NPK as a positive outcome and explains that there was an additional
 recommendation to promote balanced input usage.
 This seems inappropriate: one would expect that the promotion of balanced
 input usage would lead to an increased likelihood of adopting every input
 (perhaps at a lower quantity), rather than decreased adoption of one of
 the three recommended fertilizers.

The reviewer is correct.
 We have removed this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 It is unclear how the production index in Table 5 is constructed.
 The first two variables (maize production and maize area) generate maize
 yield (kg/acre).
 Similarly, labor productivity is a function of labor quantity.
 Therefore, it seems inappropriate to use all six variables to generate
 the index.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
This is also mentioned by reviewer 4 (R4.14).
 We did not include maize productivity (production/area) nor labour productivity
 (production/time) because of the concerns raised by the reviewer, but we
 did not explain this in the manuscript.

7.
 One important caveat of the analysis is that the outcomes are all self-reported.
 In particular, if the survey first asked questions about farming knowledge,
 the subsequent responses on farming practices may be subject to the survey
 demand effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Concerns related to self-reported outcomes and the danger of bias due to
 social desirability or experimenter demand effects have been mentioned
 by all reviewers (R1.6, R2.5,R4.7).
 We therefore added a separate section where we discuss why it is unlikely
 that our analysis is driven by social desirability bias.

A key concern with our study is the fact that we use self-reported survey
 data on key outcomes, as opposed to outcomes that are measured by a third
 party in an objective way.
 Study participants may report what they feel is desired in that context
 (social desirability bias).
 In an RCT, social desirability bias becomes a real concern if it is correlated
 to the treatment, which is sometimes referred to as experimenter demand
 effects

 less problematic than initially thought 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

before "eg."
key "de2018measuring,mummolo2019demand"

\end_inset

, we provide some discussion on why we feel experimenter demand effects
 are unlikely to drive our results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
First, during the design of the endline questionnaire, we tried to minimize
 potential experimenter demand effects by careful formulation of the questions.
 Experimenter demand effects are more likely to be a concern for simple
 yes/no questions than for more open ended questions.
 For instance, in our endline survey, we did not ask if farmers used 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plant spacing of 75cm x 30cm with a reduced seed rate of 1 seed per hill
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as recommended.
 Rather, we asked farmers to describe the planting process, and the enumerator
 was then asked to select the appropriate response from a list of options
 that was not revealed to the farmer.
 For input adoption, we started from broad questions (eg.
 whether fertilizer was used on a particular plot) and then asked farmers
 to go further into detail (eg.
 asking about fertilizer type, timing of application, quantities and price)
 allowing enumerators to detect inconsistencies that may signal experimenter
 demand effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Second, in our endline survey, not all outcomes are equally likely to be
 affected by experimenter demand effects.
 For instance, experimenter demand effects are probably less likely to be
 an issue for the multiple choice questions used to measure knowledge than
 for questions about implementation of recommended practices or the use
 of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer or improved seed.
 It is reassuring that there is consistency between effects found on questions
 that are more or less prone to experimenter demand effect.
 In other words, if we would have found that our interventions did not result
 in a change in knowledge related to optimal plant spacing, yet farmers
 report that they did use optimal plant spacing on their plots, we would
 be more worried that the latter effect was driven by experimenter demand
 effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Third, as we will report in the next section, fertilizer adoption, an outcome
 prone to experimenter demand effects, seems to increase particularly for
 treated farmers that live close to an agro-input dealer.
 This finding reduces the possibility that results are driven by misreporting
 related to experimenter demand effects, as this would mean that households
 that have better access to improved inputs strategically decide to report
 their answers differently than households that have less access to inputs.

\begin_layout Standard
Interpretation and discussion 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, the discussion of the results warrants a more nuanced interpretation
 of the results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
8.The authors equate insignificant results with no impact.
 However, the study sample may be too small to capture small effects on
 noisy agricultural outcomes.
 Given the observed variance of maize yield, what is the minimum detectable
 effect size? Is it possible that some of the analyses are underpowered?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
While we believe that the original design was generously powered (an elaborate
 series of power simulations can be found in the pre-analysis plan), we
 agree that low take-up may have attenuated the ITT effects for the incremental
 IVR and SMS treatments.
 We thus try to estimate Local Average Treatment Effects, but it is well
 known that the IV estimator loses power quickly even with moderate non-complian
ce.
 We added more discussion on this in a separate section where we discuss
 demand for IVR, SMS reception and Local Average Treatment Effects.
 The relevant section is as follows; reflection on power and corresponding
 MDEs are in the footnotes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
A first reason why we fail to find significant effects that are consistent
 with the effects from the video for the additional treatments may be because
 the partial compliance greatly reduces the power of the design.
 Only 8.9 percent of households that were selected for the IVR treatment
 also actually called in

A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that the minimum detectable effect
 (MDE) size for maize yields in the original IVR design would be about 6.4
 percent.

 In one experiment where farmers were offered to receive a call from an
 extension agent, only 8% of farmers requested a phone call during planting
 season.
 In another project, farmers also had access to a toll-free number, but

 Contamination, where farmers that were allocated to the control group end
 up calling the IVR, may also lead to a downward bias in the estimates,
 making it harder to detect a significant impact.
 However, we find that only one percent of farmers that were allocated to
 the control group called the IVR hotline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
9.
 It is not surprising that the additional effects of IVR access is small
 given that < 10% of farmers called in.
 It is possible that this intervention was not well-designed: IVR is not
 a familiar technology among the study population.
 Access to the hotline service that requires self-navigation without an
 appropriate training on how to use it may have attenuated the impact in
 this particular study.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
This is a possible explanation, although we would not call this a poorly
 designed study.
 The idea was to test the incremental effectiveness of a particular IVR
 (as implemented by Viamo).
 This model assumes no training is needed: The first time a farmer dials
 in, he/she gets information on how to use the system, and the underlying
 assumption is that this should be sufficient for a typical farmer to use
 the system.
 The messages are also designed by experts in ways that make it attractive
 to the average farmer.
 It may indeed be that different effects would have been found if a different
 version of an IVR would have been tested (eg.
 with dedicated training sessions).
 However, testing different versions of IVR was not the aim of this study.

 Similarly, the effects of SMS may depend on the message design.
 Were the SMS messages tested before the intervention to ensure that farmers
 comprehend them? 
\end_layout

We refer to the answer above in 9.
 We agree that the effect of SMS messages may depend on message design.
 Messages were not tested, but we would argue they were very easy to understand.

12.
 Cost-effectiveness analysis would be useful here given that one of the
 rationales often given for ICT interventions is its scalability at low
 cost.
 The video intervention in this study was delivered in person, increasing
 the compliance but also the cost of delivery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We agree that cost-effectiveness and scalability are big selling points
 for intervention such as the one being tested.
 This was also mentioned reviewer 4 (R4.1), and the absence of a discussion
 on cost-effectiveness was one of his/her first concerns.
 We agree that a section on cost-effectiveness is important.
 In addition, this comment is related to the second remark of the first
 reviewer (R1.2) who wanted to know how the intervention affects profitability
 of maize growing (in his/her fifth comment R1.5, questions on scalability
 are also asked).
 Estimation of cost-benefits at the farmer level are then used as input
 to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.
 For the latter, we indeed find that the cost of in person delivery is considera
ble.

While we did not collect detailed information on prices paid for inputs
 or wages.
 However, we can use the estimates above together with aggregate price data
 and some assumptions in a series of back-of-the-envelope cost and benefit
 calculations.
 We first check if the video intervention affected profitability of the
 average farmer and then compare the total cost of the intervention to the
 total benefit derived by the farmers in our study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
In our sample, a bag of 100 110 kg of maize was sold at a median price of
 UGX 60,000.
 We have seen that a control household reported yields of 430 kg per acre,
 with a corresponding value of UGX 258,000.
 In the sub-sample that received the video treatment, yields increase to
 474 kg per acre, corresponding to UGX 283,800.
 This means a difference in income of UGX 26,400 per acre, or about 7.5 USD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
From this, we subtract the cost of inputs.
 We recommended two hybrid seed, Longe 10H and UH5354 (commonly know Bazooka).
 At the time of the experiment, Longe 10H sold for UGX 6,000 per kg, while
 Bazooka costed UGX 8,500 per kg.
 However, the data shows that the use of Bazooka was marginal and not correlated
 to the treatment.
 We will therefor use only the price of Longe 10H in the cost calculations.
 We further recommended two open-pollinated varieties Longe 5 and Longe
 4.
 Among these two, Longe 5 is the most common variety.
 Both types costed about UGX 3,000 per kg.
 A farmer needs about 8 kg of seed to plant one acre.
 Inorganic fertilizers are probably the largest cost.
 The retail price of 1 kg of urea was about UGX 2,500, while DAP costed
 UGX 3,000 per kilo.
 We recommended using 60 kg of both DAP and Urea on one acre.
 We assume that organic fertilizer is free, but may increase labour cost
 (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The recommended spacing and seed rate is unlikely to increase costs of seed.
 We recommend a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with one seeds per hill.
 We assume that most farmers would use 75cm x 60cm with two seeds per hill,
 leading to the same amount of seed needed per unit of land.
 We thus simply multiply the cost of these inputs by the likelihood that
 they are applied in both control and treatment group (Table 3) and subtract
 this from the income obtained from maize.
 Doing so actually increases the difference in income between treatment
 and control somewhat, as the likelihood that farmers use the more expensive
 fertilizer DAP reduced somewhat, while the likelihood that farmers use
 Urea increased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Changes in the cost of labour are harder to value.
 Table 2 shows an increase in the practice of removing stirga early on,
 which is likely to increase labour.
 The new spacing recommendation also means more hills are needed, which
 may also have an impact on labour, as does the increased use of organic
 fertilizer.
 At the same time, we do not find that the video treatment is significantly
 correlated to the time spent on preparing the land (which includes application
 of inorganic fertilizer), to time spend on weeding, nor to the likelihood
 that labor is hired in.
 In addition, labour is very cheap at only 6,000 per day.
 Valuing work related to organic fertilizer adoption at 3 days, the adoption
 of the new planting method at 2 days and the work for weeding at 10 days
 (which is the time needed to weed one acre), the difference reduces to
 22,308 or about 6.4 USD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The intervention overall costed close to USD 37,000.
 Almost 40 percent of this are fixed costs such as the production of the
 video (USD 6,300) and the cost of procuring 20 tablets at a total cost
 of USD 5,600.
 We also needed to train the enumerators at a total cost of 2,224.
 Variable costs are estimated to be about USD 2.77 for a single screening
 to an average farmer in the area.
 This includes time for the personnel showing the video and supervision
 time, car hire with driver, and fuel needed to reach the households.
 As a result, the intervention as implemented would only break even at about
 7,000 observations.
 If the intervention is rolled out to all 360,000 households in the 5 districts
 where the intervention was piloted, the internal rate of return would be
 about 34 %

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
It may be possible to reduce variable costs considerable.
 The largest component of the variable cost is the wage of of the person
 showing the videos to individual households.
 Currently, an extension worker with a bachelor's degree costs about the
 same of what we paid our enumerators.
 One may argue that one does not need to have a university degree to show
 a video, in which case extension workers with only a diploma an be used
 at roughly USD 77,000 per day.
 This would bring the variable cost down to about USD 2.36 for a single screening
 for the average farmer.
 Other cost savings may be obtained by showing videos to groups of farmers
 instead of individually, or direct streaming of videos to devices of farmers.
 However, this touches upon potentially important design features of the
 intervention than may alter outcomes, and as such require additional testing.

 The current manuscript characterizes the three interventions as follows:
 (i) a video intervention is supply-driven and may be more appropriate in
 introducing a new technology but tends to be a one- off intervention, (ii)
 an IVR hotline is a demand-driven service, and (iii) SMS messages tend
 to be “too short to provide detailed information” but can be appropriately
 timed and hence could address behavioral constraints.
 It is plausible that the particular interventions evaluated in this study
 can be characterized as above.
 However, these technologies can be used to address various constraints
 in different settings, and the above assumptions may or may not apply to
 other settings.

 There are numerous assumptions here that may or may not be true.
 Videos are used by some organizations as a medium of information dissemination
 delivered at regular frequencies.
 As smartphone ownership increases, it will also become more accessible.
 Other organizations are delivering information on new technologies and
 agricultural practices via SMS messages.

 All of these points together highlight the importance of a more thoughtful

 improved knowledge, practices, and production, and other lighter-touch
 interventions had no additional effects – seems hasty.

 Estimation method does not include fixed effects or clustering at the geographi
c level.
 Access to extension agents, inputs, and soil characteristics may vary significa
ntly across villages and parishes.
 It would seem appropriate to use fixed effects at the geographic level.
 Furthermore, farmers within a village would be more likely to share information
 or learn from each other than farmers across villages: clustering at the
 village level may be appropriate.

 However, you are right to point out that particular design features of
 the study, such as the way the sample was drawn (two stage cluster sampling)
 and the randomization performed (blocking on village), would normally lead
 researchers to use fixed effects.
 Instead of using fixed effects (which is also controversial, see

 The permutation algorithm that was developed for this paper mimics the
 design features of the study; one does not have to control for this ex-post.
 We refer to the following eloquent description of RI by Jed Friedman that

 testing from the standard thought experiment of (repeatedly) drawing samples
 of observations from a larger known population to a thought experiment
 where the population is fixed to what is observed in the data, but treatment
 assignation itself is imagined to be repeatedly sampled.
 In this approach, the treatment value is the only random variable in the
 data and randomization creates the reference distribution of test statistics.
 All observed outcomes and covariates are assumed fixed.

 The sample size for the attrition table is so small that this analysis
 would be underpowered to detect any differential attrition.
 I would run a different analysis with a full sample regressing the indicator
 for completing the follow-up survey on treatment indicators, a vector of

 the two sets of variables.
 Joint significance across the interaction terms for each treatment indicator

Table

 presents a summary of a series of tests we did to investigate differential
 attrition.
 They relate to a series of regressions where an indicator of attrition
 is regressed upon treatment indicators and interactions with baseline character
istics.
 The first row looks at differential attrition among treatment groups.
 The first column compares attrition between the control group and households
 that received the video intervention.
 A t-test shows no significant difference in attrition between these two
 groups.
 The second column compares households that (also) received the encouragement
 treatment to those that did not (the control group and the video only group).
 Also here, there is no difference in attrition.
 We then compare attrition among the group that was allocated to the SMS
 treatment to those that were not and again find no significant difference.
 In the final column, we implement a joint test of differential attrition
 across the treatment groups.
 We do so by running a regression of the attrition indicator on dummy variables
 for the three treatments and test if all estimated coefficients are jointly
 zero.
 An F-test shows we can not reject the hypothesis of no differential attrition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We further investigate if attrition rates are correlated to baseline characteris
tics and whether this correlation differs by treatment group.
 Here the base specification regresses an indicator of attrition on a treatment
 indicator, a baseline characteristic and the interaction between the treatment
 indicator and the baseline characteristic.
 We then test if the interaction between treatment and baseline characteristic
 is significantly different from zero using a t-test.
 For instance in the first column of the second row, we do not find that
 attrition rates are related to baseline yields among households that received
 the video intervention.
 In the second column of the second row, also confirm that attrition rates
 are unrelated to baseline yields among households that received the IVR
 encouragement.
 The third column implements a similar test for the SMS subgroup.
 Finally, in the last column, we test if coefficients on yield interacted
 with each of the treatment dummies is jointly different from zero using
 an F-test.
 Also here, balance can not be rejected.
 These series of tests are repeated for each of the baseline characteristics
 that were included in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

on with the video dummy (column 1), with the IVR dummy (column 2), with
 the SMS dummy (column 3) and with all three treatment dummies jointly (column
 4) are reported.
 Overall, we find that attrition is unrelated to the treatment and also
 unrelated to baseline characteristics, except perhaps for having received
 extension at baseline.
 Attrition appears to be somewhat lower for farmers that received both video
 and received extension at baseline.
 Attrition also seems lower for the SMS treatment for this subgroup.

 Agricultural Advice to Smallholder Farmers: Experimental Evidence From
 Uganda” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper reports the results of a randomized control trial carried out
 in Uganda, evaluating the effectiveness of delivering agricultural messages
 through agricultural extension videos, coupled with SMS and IVR, on farmers’
 knowledge, agricultural practices, and yields.
 Relative to a counterfactual group the authors find increases in knowledge
 and increases in (self-reported) recommended practices and inputs and a
 ten percent increase in yields.
 The authors do not find evidence to suggest that adding SMS or IVR messages
 on top of the videos changed outcomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper describes a clean RCT carried out with a representative sample
 of almost 4,000 farmers in Uganda.
 The results provide evidence that informational frictions can limit farmer
 adoption of inputs and show the causal effects of information bundles,
 delivered through different ICTs on farmer behavior.
 The paper is clear, but I think it could be more precise about what the
 interventions are and what we can learn about them.
 Below, I list a number of issues which I think need to be addressed.

1.
 You motivate the study by saying that one of the advantages of using ICTs
 over traditional extension methods is that ICTs can be cost-effective and
 scalable.
 However, it is not immediately clear how cost-effective/scalable your video
 intervention is if it depends on field officers/extension agents visiting
 farmers.
 If the argument is that this is an evaluation of a policy-relevant approach,
 then this requires a more thorough discussion on the pros/cons of this
 technology and how relevant it is as a policy option.
 A cost-effectiveness analysis would also be important.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We agree that cost-effectiveness and scalability are big selling points
 for intervention such as the one being tested.
 This is also mentioned by reviewer 3 how notes that showing videos to individua
l farmers can be costly (R3.12).
 In addition, this comment is related to the second remark of the first
 reviewer (R1.2) who wanted to know how the intervention affects profitability
 of maize growing (in his/her fifth comment R1.5, questions on scalability
 are also asked).
 Estimation of cost-benefits at the farmer level are then used as input
 to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.
 Given this, we decided to add a section on the cost-effectiveness of the
 intervention.

\emph on
Cost-effectiveness and scalability are often major selling points for interventi
on such as the one being tested.
 While we did not collect detailed information on prices paid for inputs
 or wages we can use the estimates above together with aggregate price data
 and some assumptions in a series of back-of-the-envelope cost and benefit
 calculations.
 We first check if the video intervention affected profitability of the
 average farmer and then compare the total cost of the intervention to the
 total benefit derived by the farmers in our study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
In our sample, a bag of 100 110 kg of maize was sold at a median price of
 UGX 60,000.
 We have seen that a control household reported yields of 430 kg per acre,
 with a corresponding value of UGX 258,000.
 In the sub-sample that received the video treatment, yields increase to
 474 kg per acre, corresponding to UGX 283,800.
 This means a difference in income of UGX 26,400 per acre, or about 7.5 USD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
From this, we subtract the cost of inputs.
 We recommended two hybrid seed, Longe 10H and UH5354 (commonly know Bazooka).
 At the time of the experiment, Longe 10H sold for UGX 6,000 per kg, while
 Bazooka costed UGX 8,500 per kg.
 However, the data shows that the use of Bazooka was marginal and not correlated
 to the treatment.
 We will therefor use only the price of Longe 10H in the cost calculations.
 We further recommended two open-pollinated varieties Longe 5 and Longe
 4.
 Among these two, Longe 5 is the most common variety.
 Both types costed about UGX 3,000 per kg.
 A farmer needs about 8 kg of seed to plant one acre.
 Inorganic fertilizers are probably the largest cost.
 The retail price of 1 kg of urea was about UGX 2,500, while DAP costed
 UGX 3,000 per kilo.
 We recommended using 60 kg of both DAP and Urea on one acre.
 We assume that organic fertilizer is free, but may increase labour cost
 (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The recommended spacing and seed rate is unlikely to increase costs of seed.
 We recommend a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with one seeds per hill.
 We assume that most farmers would use 75cm x 60cm with two seeds per hill,
 leading to the same amount of seed needed per unit of land.
 We thus simply multiply the cost of these inputs by the likelihood that
 they are applied in both control and treatment group (Table 3) and subtract
 this from the income obtained from maize.
 Doing so actually increases the difference in income between treatment
 and control somewhat, as the likelihood that farmers use the more expensive
 fertilizer DAP reduced somewhat, while the likelihood that farmers use
 Urea increased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Changes in the cost of labour are harder to value.
 Table 2 shows an increase in the practice of removing stirga early on,
 which is likely to increase labour.
 The new spacing recommendation also means more hills are needed, which
 may also have an impact on labour, as does the increased use of organic
 fertilizer.
 At the same time, we do not find that the video treatment is significantly
 correlated to the time spent on preparing the land (which includes application
 of inorganic fertilizer), to time spend on weeding, nor to the likelihood
 that labor is hired in.
 In addition, labour is very cheap at only 6,000 per day.
 Valuing work related to organic fertilizer adoption at 3 days, the adoption
 of the new planting method at 2 days and the work for weeding at 10 days
 (which is the time needed to weed one acre), the difference reduces to
 22,308 or about 6.4 USD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The intervention overall costed close to USD 37,000.
 Almost 40 percent of this are fixed costs such as the production of the
 video (USD 6,300) and the cost of procuring 20 tablets at a total cost
 of USD 5,600.
 We also needed to train the enumerators at a total cost of 2,224.
 Variable costs are estimated to be about USD 2.77 for a single screening
 to an average farmer in the area.
 This includes time for the personnel showing the video and supervision
 time, car hire with driver, and fuel needed to reach the households.
 As a result, the intervention as implemented would only break even at about
 7,000 observations.
 If the intervention is rolled out to all 360,000 households in the 5 districts
 where the intervention was piloted, the internal rate of return would be
 about 34 %
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
It may be possible to reduce variable costs considerable.
 The largest component of the variable cost is the wage of of the person
 showing the videos to individual households.
 Currently, an extension worker with a bachelor's degree costs about the
 same of what we paid our enumerators.
 One may argue that one does not need to have a university degree to show
 a video, in which case extension workers with only a diploma an be used
 at roughly USD 77,000 per day.
 This would bring the variable cost down to about USD 2.36 for a single screening
 for the average farmer.
 Other cost savings may be obtained by showing videos to groups of farmers
 instead of individually, or direct streaming of videos to devices of farmers.
 However, this touches upon potentially important design features of the
 intervention than may alter outcomes, and as such require additional testing.

2.
 You should explain in more detail why studying the additional value of
 IVR and SMS over videos is relevant in the context of your actual experiment.
 Policy-wise, it might have been more natural to test each technology separately
 or to start with the cheapest technology and then add the other ones.
 You argue that with this design you might address other constraints that
 could be better addressed through SMS and IVR (e.g.
 need for reminders, or continuous access to information during shocks).
 However, you need to convince us that these additional services were not
 just offering the same information that farmers already had but that they
 were actually addressing these other constraints you discuss.
 For example, I worry that the two SMS examples you provide sound more like
 general information rather than the types of reminder/nudges that you describe
 in your introduction (e.g.
 “weed your maize”).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, I suggest you tie your conceptual description of the rationale
 for these interventions with the description of the actual features of
 your intervention more closely.
 Otherwise, it is difficult to learn anything from the null effects of these
 other technologies (e.g.
 were the hypothesized constraints not binding? was the information provided
 not targeting those constraints? would we have expected effects had farmers
 suffered a shock? Or over additional seasons? etc.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We wanted to avoid conflation of the impact of the technology with the actual
 content.
 Therefore, we tried as much as possible to make sure that no new info was
 given in the incremental treatments.
 So in a way, the additional interventions were in fact offering information
 that they should have already had (from the video intervention).
 We wanted to test if making this same information available in different
 forms, consistent with theoretical models how they could have additional
 benefits (eg.
 when I do not remember something I can look it up and if somewone repeats
 the information, I may be more likely to act upon it) would have additional
 benefits/

 Relatedly, the paper emphasizes the different technologies used to deliver
 information (SMS, IVR and videos).
 If the claim is that they are serving different needs, then you need to
 emphasize how the interventions differed from each other beyond the ICTs
 used to deliver them.
 In particular, you should spend more time discussing the differences in
 content and how these interventions were implemented.
 For example, a big difference between interventions is that for the videos
 all the farmers were individually visited at home whereas IVR was offered
 through an encouragement design.

 who visited the farmers? what were the protocols to invite farmers? could
 farmers opt-out?).

\emph on
The information provided was rather specific.
 For instance, in the video we show in detail how land should be prepared
 using organic fertilizer, how to plant in rows with optimal spacing, when
 to plant and when to weed.
 A lot of attention is devoted to identifying striga early on and farmers
 are encouraged to remove it early to avoid the weed from affecting the
 maize.
 In terms of inputs, we promote the use of improved seed.
 We recommend using hybrids, and if that is too expensive, at least go for
 open pollinated varieties.
 We even go as far as recommending two particular types of each (Longe 10H
 and Bazooka for hybrids, Longe 5 and Longe 4 for OPVs).
 For inorganic fertilizers, we recommend basal application of DAP or NPK
 at planting and top dressing of Urea during the growing stage.
 For all inputs, optimal quantities and proper application methods are shown.
 The video also recommends a commercial approach to farmers.
 We point out how investing now can make a farmer grow over time and that
 it is often better to start small using all the inputs and practices that
 only using eg good seed on the entire plot but no fertilizer.
 We tried as much as possible to provide the same info through the IVR.
 For instance, also here the same seeds and fertilizer were named, and the
 same quantities recommended and application methods explained.
 In general, there was a very close correspondence between what we recommend
 and the outcomes that were used to assess the impact of the intervention.

 There is not much information on whether we would have expected the advice

Controversial may be the wrong wording.
 It is just a new way of spacing that deviates from what farmers have been
 doing for centuries and what most extension workers are teaching (and also
 what is indicated on the bags of seed).
 So it may be controversial from the point of view of the farmer.
 It is not controversial in that it may not be correct.
 It is a better way of spacing and it is the official recommendation for
 all future agricultural extension information dissemination in Uganda.

 In the adoption tables, you code effects on opposite directions as ‘correct’
 when you construct your indexes.
 This seems arbitrary.
 For instance, you claim that “one can argue that DAP/NPK is higher than
 optimal and urea is lower than optimal” and therefore interpret the positive/ne
gative direction of the effects as following the advice.
 You do a similar thing for the negative effect on organic fertilizers for
 the IVR arm.
 You should be more transparent on what was the recommendation and what
 was the hypothesized direction of the effects ex-ante.

 A potential issue with projects that use self-reported data following an

 bias.
 I would like to know how much of a problem this might be in this context.
 Were the same field officers providing the intervention and collecting
 the data? Were there any backchecks that you could use to compare discrepancy
 between answers? Additionally, can you report how robust are the yield
 results to outliers, etc?

Concerns related to self-reported outcomes and the danger of bias due to
 social desirability or experimenter demand effects have been mentioned
 by all reviewers (R1.6, R2.5,R3.7).
 We therefore added a separate section where we discuss why it is unlikely
 that our analysis is driven by social desirability bias.
 We considered your suggestion to confirm application of the practice of
 plan spacing by using quantities of seed used.
 However, the default spacing uses virtually the same quantity of seed per
 acre (see also the additional section on cost-effectiveness).

A key concern with our study is the fact that we use self-reported survey

 In an RCT, social desirability bias becomes a real concern if it is correlated

, we provide some discussion on why we feel experimenter demand effects
 are unlikely to drive our results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
First, during the design of the endline questionnaire, we tried to minimize
 potential experimenter demand effects by careful formulation of the questions.
 Experimenter demand effects are more likely to be a concern for simple
 yes/no questions than for more open ended questions.
 For instance, in our endline survey, we did not ask if farmers used 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plant spacing of 75cm x 30cm with a reduced seed rate of 1 seed per hill
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as recommended.
 Rather, we asked farmers to describe the planting process, and the enumerator
 was then asked to select the appropriate response from a list of options
 that was not revealed to the farmer.
 For input adoption, we started from broad questions (eg.
 whether fertilizer was used on a particular plot) and then asked farmers
 to go further into detail (eg.
 asking about fertilizer type, timing of application, quantities and price)
 allowing enumerators to detect inconsistencies that may signal experimenter
 demand effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Second, in our endline survey, not all outcomes are equally likely to be
 affected by experimenter demand effects.
 For instance, experimenter demand effects are probably less likely to be
 an issue for the multiple choice questions used to measure knowledge than
 for questions about implementation of recommended practices or the use
 of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer or improved seed.
 It is reassuring that there is consistency between effects found on questions
 that are more or less prone to experimenter demand effect.
 In other words, if we would have found that our interventions did not result
 in a change in knowledge related to optimal plant spacing, yet farmers
 report that they did use optimal plant spacing on their plots, we would
 be more worried that the latter effect was driven by experimenter demand
 effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Third, as we will report in the next section, fertilizer adoption, an outcome
 prone to experimenter demand effects, seems to increase particularly for
 treated farmers that live close to an agro-input dealer.
 This finding reduces the possibility that results are driven by misreporting
 related to experimenter demand effects, as this would mean that households
 that have better access to improved inputs strategically decide to report
 their answers differently than households that have less access to inputs.

 At some points in the paper, the way you phrase the interventions creates
 the illusion that you are running a horse-race between IVR, SMS and videos.
 For instance, your title and abstract mention “ICT to provide agricultural
 advice”.
 However, the IVR arm only gave farmers access to information and the SMS
 was (at least conceptually) meant to serve as reminders not as information
 provision.
 At another point you say “IVR did not have a strong influence on the modern
 use of inputs or management practices”.
 This should read “additional advice through IVR.”

 I disagree with your statement that “SMS cannot be used to provide new

 Some of the papers you cite use SMS to provide agricultural information.
 Several companies/NGOs around the world also use SMS to provide agricultural
 advice.
 You probably might want to qualify this claim a bit more.

 We have rewritten the manuscript and avoided the strong claims up front.
 In fact, the entire demand vs supply driven farming has been deferred to
 the conclusion as potential reasons why we do not find an effect.
 In other words, we now employ a much more agnostic approach of what IVR
 and SMS can and can not do and interpret the findings in the light of the
 demand vs supply framework, instead of using it to characterize the interventio

 Could you clarify whether the knowledge questions were framed as (i) what
 farmers thought was correct (which might have been different from what
 the video showed) or (ii) what farmers remembered what the video said?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The outcome that is used in the paper is what farmers thought was correct,
 and hence this was how it was framed.
 We framed the question this way as this seemed to be the most interesting
 question.
 The eventual aim of interventions like this is to change behaviour, not
 merely increasing knowledge.
 Therefore, the interesting outcome to measure is a change in what farmers
 think is correct.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Changes made to the text: we have explicitly added that we ask for the opinion
 of the farmer, which may be different from what the farmer recalls from
 the video.
 For each question, three possible answers were read out to the respondent,
 who was then asked to indicate which answer he or she thought was correct
 (which may differ from what he or she recalled from the video)

 I think it is very interesting that you see a reduction of land cultivated.
 This seems to be in line with the intervention that told farmers to intensively
 combine inputs in smaller parts of their land.
 You should show us that these effects are not driven by outliers or clear
 misreports in the land size measure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We do not think our results are driven by outliers.
 As is specified in our pre-analysis plan, we conduct analysis on 5 percent
 trimmed values of continuous variables.
 The pre-analysis plan also states that trimming is always done on the end
 result just before the analysis.
 For instance for area, we first take the logarithm and then trim.
 For yield, we first divide production by area, then take the logarithm
 and then trim.
 Trimming at 10 percent leads to the same results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 For the yield index, you double count the effect of land size by including
 it by itself and as a ratio.
 Can you show with only one? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

This was also mentioned by reviewer 3 (R3.6).
 We did not include maize productivity (production/area) nor labour productivity
 (production/time) because of the concerns raised by the reviewer, but we
 did not explain this in the manuscript.

 I suggest you move the discussion of spillovers to the main body of the
 paper rather than having it as the last paragraph in the conclusion.
 You want to show us or at least discuss that these potential spillover
 effects are not big enough that we are not learning anything from the null
 effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We have removed the discussion related to spillover effects from the conclusion.
 Even though we agree that also for the video intervention spillover effects
 may lead to an increase in (positive) outcomes in the control an as such
 make it more difficult to identify significant effects that may be present,
 we do not discuss the issue there as we find significant effects regardless.
 However, in the section that presents the LATE effects, we do reflect on
 the likelihood that spillovers are responsible for the null effects.
 We conclude that it is unlikely that spillovers are responsible for the
 null effects.
\end_layout

 You mention that you carry out LATE estimations but that those results
 are only available upon request.
 I would like to see those in an online appendix that could be easily accessible
 for the reader.

 These were all materials we would have liked to make available in on-line
 appendices.
 It included the 2SLS (LATE) regressions, and an anonymized version of the
 pre-analysis plan (among others).
 It seems that these materials were not part of what the reviewers could
 access.

 of the paper, as the some of the other reviewers indicated it would be

 Since farmers were visited twice for the videos, that could have already
 served as a reminder and could explain why the SMS were not effective.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Farmers were shown the video twice before and early in the agricultural
 season, with the intention of providing all the information farmers needed.
 The SMS messages reminded farmers of particular topics discussed in the
 video at particular points in time, the idea being that timely reminders
 would make the information more salient.
 They also included a reminder that farmers could use the IVR.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
One can speculate about the potential reasons why the reminders did not
 work in our case.
 The fact that farmers were already reminded once and reminders have decreasing
 marginal effects may be one potential reason.
 Another reason may be that we found it difficult to get the timing right.
 While we tried to avoid excessive difference in agro-ecological conditions,
 we still encountered situations where farmers had planted much earlier
 than in other areas due to spatial heterogeneity in the onset of the rains.
 As a result, some farmers will have received the SMS message on fertilizer
 application too early and others too late.
 Maybe the content of the reminders was to blame, and a more imperative
 tone such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 might have been more effective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
More in general, and also alluded to by reviewer 3 (R.13, R.14 and R.15), we
 feel a more agnostic stance as to what we can actually learn from our experimen
t about the mechanisms behind our SMS intervention is in order.
 We thus rewrote the manuscript and are more cautious in interpretation
 of null effects.

 Are you controlling for unbalanced characteristics in your specifications?
 Do results change if you do/don’t? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
This was also mentioned by reviewer 2 (R2.9).
 While there is some imbalance, this seems to be within what one would expect
 by chance alone.
 Furthermore, joint balance is never rejected.
 In addition, the imbalance is only for the additional IVR and SMS treatments,
 for which we find little effects.
 As such, imbalance can not be responsible for the impact of the video intervent
ion we find (which would be the biggest concern).
 That said, we have redone the analysis where we now control for the variables
 where imbalances were found.
 The results are reported in Tables

 It would be useful to say something about whether wives in this context
 are likely to have their own phone or if they are dependent on their husband’s
 phone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The intervention that is discussed in this study was conceptualized at the
 household level, and outcomes are also defined at that level.
 Mobile phone ownership, and how it is distributed within the household,
 was taken as given.
 This obviously does not mean that phone ownership will not affect outcomes,
 and we do look at heterogeneity in treatment effects due to mobile phone
 ownership in a separate subsection in section 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Additional analysis and robustness tests

 Unfortunately, we did not ask about individual phone ownership at baseline,
 so we can not condition on this.
 We only asked if the household had access to a mobile phone.

 In the conclusion, you say that “farmers increasing the use of certain
 fertilizers and reducing use of others.
 As a result, [...] increased their yields”.
 I don’t think you can claim with certainty what drove effects in yields.

We agree and have removed this from the conclusion.
 See also your fifth comment, as well as the comment from reviewer 3 (R3.5).

 The finding that farmers did not think that yields improved is quite interestin
g since that might affect sustained adoption.
 This is outside scope of this piece but would be very interesting to see
 if adoption was sustained over the next season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We take your point.
 We note that the video intervention does increase the outcome by about
 6 percent, but it is indeed not significant.
 It is true that this may affect sustainability of the intervention and
 we too would like to collect another round of data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
At the same time, and in hindsight, we also suspect that the insignificant
 result may be due to a poorly formulated question.
 While the measure of maize yield is obtained indirectly by dividing production
 on the plot by the size of the plot, here the farmer is asked to directly
 assess maize yield on the plot.
 We fear many farmers may find it difficult to convert production on the
 plot to yields, and therefore compared production on the plot to what it
 normally would be.
 If farmers intensify production on only part of the plot and leave the
 rest fallow (or fill it up with eg beans), they may indicate that maize
 production on the plot was similar to what they normally get from that
 plot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Changes made to the text: The following footnote was added to the part where
 the insignificant result on subjective assessment of yield is reported:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Farmers may have confused yields with production.
 Consistent with our recommendation to start small and combine technologies
 and the results that yield effects are due to producing the same amounts
 on smaller plots, farmers may indicate that on the plot the same amount
 of maize was produced when part was left fallow or planted with another
 crop.

Note: Column 1 reports differences between video only and video+ivr (and
 standard error) with its corresponding p-value in column 2; column 3 reports
 differences between video+ivr and video+ivr+SMS (and standard error) with
 its corresponding p-value in column 4; sample size is reported in column
 5.
 Reported p-values are based on randomization inference (10,000 permutations);
 ***, ** and * denote that the difference is signficant at the 1, 5 and
 10 percent level, respectively, after correcting for multiple hypothesis
 testing using a family-wise sharp null (10,000 permutations).
 All specifications control for the other orthogonal factors in the factorial
 design.
 Additional controls for the IVR treatment are  age of household head at
 baseline, household size at baseline and number of bedrooms at baseline.
 Additional controls for the SMS treatment are  number of bedrooms at baseline.
