Reviewer 1 - Referee report: AJAE MS 19030, “Information and communication
 technologies (ICTs) to provide agricultural advice to smallholder farmers:
 Experimental evidence from Uganda.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper presents the results of an RCT designed to measure the impact
 of agricultural extension information for smallholder maize farmers in
 eastern Uganda provided in three ways using ICT: (i) informational videos
 shown to farmers (in-person on a tablet, twice), (ii) an invitation to
 an IVR-based information hotline that farmers could call on demand, and
 (iii) reminder SMS messages about agricultural practices and the hotline.
 The intervention was incremental---other than a pure control group, treated
 farmers received (i), (i) and (ii), or (i), (ii), and (iii) (i.e.
 no farmers received an invitation to the IVR-based hotline without also
 seeing the videos).
 The authors find that farmers retain the new information provided to them
 in the videos and that they change their behavior accordingly, leading
 to an increase in yields of 10 percent.
 They find no increased impact of inviting farmers to the IVR-based hotline
 nor of the reminder SMS messages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps the greatest strength of this study is the care which the authors
 put into what information was provided to farmers and when.
 This is evident in the description of the process by which the authors
 determined what information to provide farmers and how to package it.
 It is no surprise to me given this care that the information was valuable
 and that farmers absorbed it and some acted on it.
 As such, I believe this paper presents a clear contribution in how agricultural
 extension information provision, if done carefully, can have an impact.
 This is especially important given how split the literature is on the possible
 impacts of information provision for farmers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the same time, perhaps the two greatest weaknesses of this study are
 both features of the design that are fixed---the incremental design rather
 than a true test of supply-driven versus demand-driven information and
 the short-term nature of the outcomes.
 In the former case, the authors (I believe rightfully) highlight the tension
 between supply-driven information provision (experts deciding what information
 farmers would benefit from and giving it to them) and demand-driven (making
 information available but letting farmers seek out what information they
 want when they want it).
 But then the incremental design of the study prohibits the authors from
 actually testing supply- vs demand-driven information provision in a meaningful
 way.
 The challenge with the short-term nature of the outcomes is that the authors
 find increased yield per acre of land for treated farmers relative to control
 but no increase in total maize output and, at the same time, changes in
 inputs.
 We are left not knowing if households are actually better off in the short
 term, or even better off in the sense that they may have made changes that
 come at a cost in the short-term but are worthwhile in the medium-/long-term.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While these two weaknesses are fixed, I believe the authors can better address
 them: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 While the paper is very clear that only incremental impacts are being measured
 of the second and third intervention, I still find the supply- versus demand-dr
iven framing to be misleading.
 This is especially the case given the very low take-up of the IVR-based
 hotline.
 I would remove it from front-and-center (i.e.
 the intro and research aim sections) and instead discuss this tension and
 exactly what this study is able to tell us about supply versus demand in
 a short section at the end of the results, or in the conclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We agree that the incremental set-up of the experiment prevents us from
 directly comparing the effectiveness of supply- vs demand-driven information
 provision in a meaningful way.
 Putting this front-and-center may indeed create the expectation that we
 are going to implement a horse race-type experiment instead of the incremental
 design we use.We also note that other reviewers take issue with the supply-
 versus demand-framing, and especially the fact that we use this to motivate
 our paper.
 By de-emphasizing the supply- vs.
 demand-driven extension narrative (as suggested by the reviewer), we believe
 that we can still demonstrate that this is a useful experiment, and that
 the incremental design makes more sense than other combinations (eg.
 starting with the lowest-cost intervention, which would be SMS messages;
 see also comment 2 by reviewer 4 (R4.2.)).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
To clarify our motivation, we need to explain why we wanted to test a comprehens
ive ICT-mediated extension package consisting of different components each
 with its own characteristics.
 The different components of the intervention, and the incremental way in
 which they were implemented in the experiment, are the result of careful
 analysis of the situation in Uganda (low levels of knowledge on modern
 input due to a near-defunct public extension system, various start-ups
 experimenting with demand-driven initiatives such as WeFarm, DrumNet, Viamo,...
 ), as well as state of the art in the literature (the aspirations literature
 and importance of role models, reminders as nudges, etc.).
 With these points in mind, we decided we needed to start from a general
 baseline intervention designed to make farmers aware of the most important
 new technologies and recommended practices.
 We hypothesized that the success of such messaging would depend partly
 on their provision in an appealing and accessible manner that was specifically
 tailored to less-educated farmers.
 Hence the idea to create a video.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
However, we also know from our contextual analysis that farmers who view
 a video at the beginning of the maize growing season may tend to forget
 some of the details that are explained in the video (for instance the name
 of a particular maize hybrid, the exact quantity of a particular type of
 inorganic fertilizer, etc.).
 Therefore, we wanted to add an information source for farmers that is accessibl
e on demand.
 The idea that IVR is used to provide more precise information on a particular
 technology means that farmers already need to have an idea of the existence
 of the particular technology.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Finally, we learned from our contextual analysis and literature review that
 knowledge only is rarely enough to change behavior.
 Timely reminders have been shown to be very effective in overcoming inertia,
 procrastination, competing obligations, or simple forgetfulness

 Recent research on agricultural extension also suggests behavioral change
 occurs through the compounding or re-emphasis of common knowledge that,
 through repetition, becomes more salient to the individual

 Hence, we introduced the SMS treatment as a complement to the tailored
 informational treatment (video) and the detailed on-demand informational
 treatment (IVR).

Changes made to the manuscript: We have removed the discussion on supply-
 versus demand-driven technologies from the introduction and motivation
 section.
 We now mention the demand- driven nature of the IVR treatment only in the
 context of the low take-up we observe, which in turn may explain the null
 results for the incremental IVR effect.
 We have rewritten the introduction to better reflect how the different
 component of the intervention are related to each other, and we now better
 explain the rationale for making it an incremental design.
 Specifically, we have included the following language.

This article investigates the effectiveness of an ICT-mediated extension
 approach designed to provide information about improved maize cultivation
 practices to smallholder farmers in Uganda.
 The approach consisting of three complementary information technologies,
 tested in an incremental design.
 First, we look at the effectiveness of short audiovisual messages that
 provide detailed information on how to improve maize cultivation, that
 were shown to farmers on tablet computers.
 The strength of video is that it can combine audio and visual information
 in an attractive way that is recognizable to the potentially illiterate
 farmer.
 Second, we add an IVR service with the same information.
 In an IVR system, a farmer calls a phone number and navigates through a
 menu to select a topic.
 The farmer then gets to listen to a pre-recorded message with information
 on the selected topic.
 The decision to make the same information available in the form of an on-demand
 service is motivated by the fact that farmers may easily forget some of
 the details of the video.
 Third, we add SMS messages that remind farmers at particular points in
 time during the maize growing season about key farming practices shown
 in the video and available on demand through the IVR system, as often informati
on alone is insufficient to change behaviour.
 Timely reminders have been found very effective in overcoming inertia,
 procrastination, competing obligations, or simple forgetfulness of human
 beings

, and repetition can make information more salient

.
 The outcomes used to assess the effectiveness of this approach and its
 components include increases in knowledge about improved maize cultivation,
 changes in the use of improved inputs and recommended agronomic practices,
 and production.

While we establish clear effects from the video intervention, it is less
 clear what we can learn from the null results for the additional treatments.
 In other studies, IVR or hot-lines have been shown to have impact

 Therefore, the lack of impact may be specific to the nature of the design
 and results may be quite different in, for instance, a parallel design.

why would the incremental design have lower impact than parallel?

\begin_layout Plain Layout

But even in the narrow context of our experiment where an effort was made
 to study particular characteristics of the interventions such as the demand-dri
ven nature of IVR or the ability of SMS to make information more salient,
 it is not clear if the lack of impact should be taken to mean much.
 For instance, in Sub-section 5.1 we now argue that the low take-up of the
 IVR is likely to reduce statistical power to such extent that any reasonable
 effect cannot be detected anymore.
 Maybe, with some additional promotion of the service, positive effects
 would have been obtained.
 The SMS intervention also has its issues.
 Here, even after restricting to farmers that own a mobile phone, the implicit
 assumption that everyone with a mobile phone also reads, internalizes the
 information received in a message, and acts upon the messages may be too
 optimistic.

2.
 On the short-term nature of the outcomes measured, I think that the paper
 would benefit from a direct discussion of the potential costs and benefits
 of the changes that farmers make in response to treatment.
 Does the recommended planting spacing take the same time or more or less
 in terms of farm labor? And how labor-costly is increased weeding and pest
 control? And the authors should be able to back-of-the-envelope prices
 of different fertilizer and seed inputs and give us a sense of whether
 farmers are investing more as a result of the changes that they are making.
 And if we assume they in the next planting season use all of their land
 with a 10% higher yield, would they be better off? Put another way, if
 farmers are actually spending the same amount on inputs (including labor)
 but are changing to a more productive mix, they would necessarily be better
 off and that should be a highlight of the paper.

This comment is also related to the first comment made by reviewers 3 and
 4 (R3.12, R4.1), who, in addition to a cost-benefit analysis at the level
 of the farmer, also want an estimate of the cost-effectiveness of project.
 We added a separate section in which we first check if the video intervention
 affected the profitability for the average farmer, and then compare the
 total cost of the intervention to the total benefit derived by the farmers
 in our study.
 We only estimate cost-effectiveness for the video intervention, as we find
 few additional effects of the additional interventions.

Cost-effectiveness and scalability are often major selling points for interventi
ons such as the ones being tested.
 While we did not collect detailed information on prices paid for inputs
 or the cost of labour, we can use the estimates above together with aggregate
 price data and some assumptions in a series of back-of-the-envelope cost
 and benefit calculations.
 We first check if the video intervention affected profitability of the
 average farmer and then compare the total cost of the intervention to the
 total benefit derived by the farmers in our study.

In our sample, a bag of 100 kg of maize was sold at a median price of UGX
 60,000.
 We have seen that a control household reported yields of 430 kg per acre,
 with a corresponding value of UGX 258,000.
 In the sub-sample that received the video treatment, yields increased to
 475 kg per acre, corresponding to UGX 285,000.
 This means a difference in income of UGX 27,000 per acre, or about 7.7 USD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
From this, we subtract the cost of inputs.
 In the intervention, we recommended two hybrid seed types, Longe 10H and
 UH5354 (commonly known as Bazooka).
 At the time of the experiment, Longe 10H sold for UGX 6,000 per kg, while
 Bazooka costed UGX 8,500 per kg.
 However, the data shows that the use of Bazooka was marginal and not correlated
 to the treatment.
 We will therefor use only the price of Longe 10H in the cost calculations.
 We further recommended two open-pollinated varieties: Longe 5 and Longe
 4.
 Among these two, Longe 5 is the most common variety.
 Both types costed about UGX 3,000 per kg.
 A farmer needs about 8 kg of seed to plant one acre.
 Inorganic fertilizers are probably the largest cost.
 The retail price of 1 kg of urea was about UGX 2,500, while DAP costed
 UGX 3,000 per kilo.
 We recommended using 60 kg of both DAP and Urea on one acre.
 We assume that organic fertilizer is free, but may increase labour cost
 (see below).
 The spacing and seed rate we recommend in the intervention is unlikely
 to increase the costs of seed.
 We recommend a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with one seeds per hill.
 Most farmers would use 75cm x 60cm with two seeds per hill, leading to
 the same amount of seed needed per unit of land.
 We thus simply multiply the cost of these inputs by the likelihood that
 they were applied in both control and treatment group (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

) and subtract this from the income obtained from maize.
 Doing so actually increases the difference in income between treatment
 and control somewhat, as the likelihood that farmers use the more expensive
 fertilizer DAP reduced somewhat as a result of the treatment, while the
 likelihood that farmers use Urea increased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
Changes in the cost of labour are harder to value.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_h1_ag"

\end_inset

 shows an increase in the practice of removing striga early on, which is
 likely to increase labour.
 The new spacing recommendation also means more hills are needed, which
 may also have an impact on labour, as does the increased use of organic
 fertilizer.
 At the same time, in our endline data, we do not find that the video treatment
 is significantly correlated to the time spent on preparing the land (which
 includes application of inorganic fertilizer), to time spend on weeding,
 nor to the likelihood that labor is hired in.
 In addition, labour is very cheap (6,000 UGX per day).
 Valuing work related to organic fertilizer adoption at 3 days, the adoption
 of the new planting method at 2 days and the work for weeding at 10 days
 (which is the time needed to weed one acre), the difference in profit between
 treatment and control reduces to 22,464 UGX or about 6.5 USD per acre

The intervention costed close to USD 37,000.
 Almost 40 percent of this are fixed costs such as the production of the
 video (USD 6,300) and the cost of procuring 20 tablets at a total cost
 of USD 5,600.
 We also needed to train the enumerators at a total cost of USD 2,224.
 Variable costs are estimated to be about USD 2.77 for a single screening
 to an average farmer in the area.
 This includes time for the personnel showing the video and supervision
 time, car hire with driver, and fuel needed to reach the households.
 As a result, the intervention as implemented would only break even at about
 15,000 observations.
 If the intervention is rolled out to all 360,000 households in the 5 districts
 where the intervention was piloted, the internal rate of return would be
 about 16 %

i am puzzled: total cost - fixed costs (37000-6300-5600-224)=22876 usd .
 for 3959 farmers.
 => that would make 5.77 usd variable cost/farmer.
 (confusing when you put 2.77 usd for a single screening of the the video
 ) (and more confusing when you then calculate IRR when you roll out the
 intervention as implemented (2xvideo+ivr+sms)

alternatively, you could consider the fixed costs as sunk costs once an
 intervention like this is designed and enumerators trained.
 this leaves you with variable cost of 5.77 (??) usd per farmer to implement
 the intervention.
 a treated farmer gains 6.5 usd/acre with average 1.19 acres of maize.
 so a gain of 0.85 usd/farmer.

It may be possible to reduce variable costs considerably.
 The largest component of the variable cost was the cost of the person showing
 the videos to individual households.
 Currently, an extension worker with a bachelor's degree costs about the
 same of what we paid our enumerators (UGX 100,000 per day).
 One may argue that one does not need to have a university degree to show
 a video, in which case extension workers with only a diploma can be used
 at roughly UGX 77,000 per day.
 This would bring the variable cost down to about USD 2.36 for a single screening
 to the average farmer.
 Other cost savings may be obtained by showing videos to groups of farmers
 instead of individually, or direct streaming of videos to devices of farmers.
 However, this touches upon potentially important design features of the
 intervention than may alter outcomes, and as such require additional testing.

3.
 I think it is too late to first mention the poor take-up of the IVR-based
 hotline on page 12.
 I think that it should be highlighted from the intro and on as a potential
 reason for the lack of impacts.
 Relatedly, I think that the empirical results on the IVR-system take-up
 and SMS message receipt should be presented, including both the LATE results
 themselves and regressions of take-up on farmer characteristics to help
 interpret selection into take-up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reviewer 2 (R2.2) also suggests a more in-depth discussion of the LATE results.
 This reviewer's main concern is related to potential contamination of the
 control group to explain the lack of impact found for the IVR.
 Also reviewer 3 suggests that the lack of impact of IVR as assessed by
 the ITT may be due to the low take-up (R3.9).
 The original submission of this manuscript was accompanied by a pdf document

We now discuss the low take-up of the IVR intervention earlier in the paper.
 In a section entitled

, we explain that farmers self-select into the IVR treatment.
 We then present regressions that show how uptake is correlated to baseline
 characteristics.
 We discuss LATE effects briefly, and refer to tables in the appendix for
 completeness.
 We note that results do not change all that much.

\begin_layout Standard

We then reflect on potential reasons for the lack of impact.
 We examine take-up and using simple back-of-the-envelope calculations show
 the minimum detectable effect size and how it is affected by low compliance.
 We then argue that contamination is unlikely to lead to a downward bias,
 as only 1 percent of households in the control group called the IVR.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We then discuss a particular concern with our measure of compliance.
 In particular, we suspect that our indicator of take-up of the intervention
 is likely to significantly underestimate true compliance.
 In particular, our indicator of compliance is taken from the IVR system
 log, where recorded telephone numbers are matched to phone numbers that
 were recorded during baseline data collection.
 This indicator is likely to severely under-report true compliance, as encourage
d farmers may have used different phones to call the IVR.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
The fact that 430 unique calls to the system were recorded, representing
 about 18 percent of encouraged households, confirms this suspicion.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Using our measure of compliance, we cannot maintain the exclusion restriction
 holds, as some of the potential outcomes are directly determined by the
 instrument.
 The problem becomes apparent when we think about LATE as the Wald estimator
 that scales the ITT by compliance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "angrist_mostly_2008"

\end_inset

.
 In our case, the ITT will be estimated on the basis of all farmers encouraged
 to call in to the IVR system.
 Our measure of compliance forces the LATE estimation to work with the 214
 households that show up in the IVR log and could be identified in the baseline,
 rather than through the 430 farmers that called in, which in the case of
 a positive impact would lead to an overestimate of the impact of the treatment
 among compliers.
 It is well known that especially in the context of a weak first stage,
 the bias can become extremely large 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 We thus conclude that LATE results are difficult to interpret and suggest
 to instead focus on the ITT effects.

Redoing the LATE analysis made us realize that actually all farmers that
 were allocated to the SMS treatment did receive the SMS messages.
 As a result, we dropped the LATE analysis for this component of the interventio

 receive the messages.

 It would be very helpful to better understand the population of study in
 this paper relative to those studied in similar interventions (i.e.
 representativeness to other populations in Africa, and even South Asia
 and/or Latin America) and the result of this paper relative to other results
 in terms of magnitudes.
 The paper says “the use of modern inputs...is very low in Uganda” and “Maize
 is especially important in eastern Uganda,” for example.
 Both of these comments could be backed with data.
 Similarly, while I believe the sampling was done correctly, the UNHS could
 be used to empirically show how representative the finally selected HHs
 are relative to Uganda as a whole, etc.

The representativeness of the sampled households, and the external validity
 of the overall study, bears closer consideration, as suggested by the reviewer.T
he population from which we sample in this study are, broadly, the Baganda,
 a Bantu ethnic group native to Buganda, a subnational kingdom within Uganda.
 Maize is important in Bagandan culture, and most households in the area
 cultivate and consume maize.
 Their maize-based farming system and maize consumption patterns are generally
 an accurate reflection of populations in the larger region of eastern and
 southern Africa.
 Throughout this region, maize is similarly consumed as a staple in the
 form of a porridge that goes by different names (posho in Uganda; ugali
 in Kenya and Tanzania; ssima in Zambia; sadza in Zimbabwe; etc..).
 Many prior and ongoing studies in the region have similarly focused on
 maize-based farming systems and on households where maize is the main staple
 food.
 Many of the projects reported in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 are being implemented among similar farmers.
 While there is, in fact, considerable variation in farming systems, staple
 foods, and consumption patterns throughout Uganda, we abstract from this
 variation to focus on the central relevance of maize to both production
 and consumption in the wider eastern and southern Africa region.

 fertilizer.
 In Tanzania, this is almost 20 percent, while in Malawi, heavy subsidies
 increase this rate to 80 percent.
 Furthermore, they report that about 27 percent of maize farmers reports
 using improved seed.
 In both Tanzania and Malawi, one in two farmers report using improved seed.
 Experts also told us that low yields are due to farmers not adhering to
 recommended practices.

 Relatedly, given how well it sounds this intervention was implemented,
 I believe the paper would benefit from a brief discussion of the representative
ness of the implementation and implementing partner(s).
 Who were the “trained field enumerators” and how do they compare to average
 extension workers (i.e.
 could this intervention realistically be scaled with a government or a
 medium-capacity non-profit)? And how established is Viamo in Uganda? I
 believe establishing external validity in terms of both the population
 being studied and the implementation of the intervention is necessary to
 ensure this paper’s contribution to a mixed literature.

 think this is a realistic intervention.
 For the video intervention, we do not think a lot of training is needed.
 In fact, the use of video was partly motivated by the fact that it provides
 a homogeneous treatment (that is, independent of the person who provides
 the information) for some of the other hypotheses we wanted to test in
 the larger research project (see footnote 1 in the manuscript).
 We used trained field enumerators because they also needed to collect some
 baseline information during the first screening.
 These enumerators all had bachelor degrees, but this is probably not needed
 to just show a video.
 During the calculations of the cost of the intervention, we note that eg.
 extension workers with only a diploma could be used to reduce the cost.
 Showing videos individually is only one way of disseminating information
 using video.
 Group screenings are also often organized.
 If farmers have appropriate devices and network coverage, videos can be
 streamed to the intended beneficiaries.
 Local television channels also often have programs about farming.
 That said, these may qualify as different interventions.

Uganda has been struggling to set up a functioning extension service.
 In 2000, the National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS), an ambitious
 public private partnership was set up with support from various donors.
 After what seemed a successful start, NAADS became a victim of political
 capture and governance problems, culminating in its demise and replacement
 by Operation Wealth Creation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Operation Wealth Creation is managed by the army, and primarily focused
 on the distribution of inputs.
 Today, access to public extension services is limited.
 The last available data, obtained from the Uganda National Panel Survey
 (wave 2013/2014) suggests 20 percent of household received extension in
 the past 12 months.
 Recently, private initiatives and international social enterprises have
 started to fill the void.
 For example, Viamo's 3-2-1 service provides agricultural information through
 IVR.
 The Market-led, User-owned ICT4Ag-enabled Information Service (MUIIS) project
 uses ICT to facilitate farmer-to-farmer extension.
 Through the m-Omulimisa platform, farmers can send SMS messages with questions
 to agricultural extension officers.

A key concern with this study is the use of self-reported survey data on
 key outcomes, as opposed to outcomes that are measured by a third party
 in an objective way.
 Study participants may report what they feel is desired in that context
 (social desirability bias).
 In an RCT, social desirability bias becomes a real concern if it is correlated
 to the treatment, which is sometimes referred to as experimenter demand
 effects

 less problematic than initially thought

, we provide some discussion on why we feel experimenter demand effects
 are unlikely to drive our results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
First, during the design of the endline questionnaire, we tried to minimize
 potential experimenter demand effects by careful formulation of the questions.
 Experimenter demand effects are more likely to be a concern for simple
 yes/no questions than for more open ended questions.
 For instance, in our endline survey, we did not ask if farmers used 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plant spacing of 75cm x 30cm with a reduced seed rate of 1 seed per hill
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as recommended.
 Rather, we asked farmers to describe the planting process, and the enumerator
 was then asked to select the appropriate response from a list of options
 that was not revealed to the farmer.
 For input adoption, we started from broad questions (eg.
 whether fertilizer was used on a particular plot) and then asked farmers
 to go further into detail (eg.
 asking about fertilizer type, timing of application, quantities and price)
 allowing enumerators to detect inconsistencies that may signal experimenter
 demand effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
Second, in our endline survey, not all outcomes are equally likely to be
 affected by experimenter demand effects.
 For instance, experimenter demand effects are probably less likely to be
 an issue for the multiple choice questions used to measure knowledge than
 for questions about implementation of recommended practices or the use
 of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer or improved seed.
 It is reassuring that there is consistency between effects found on questions
 that are more or less prone to experimenter demand effect.
 In other words, if we would have found that our interventions did not result
 in a change in knowledge related to optimal plant spacing, yet farmers
 report that they did use optimal plant spacing on their plots, we would
 be more worried that the latter effect was driven by experimenter demand
 effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
Third, as we will report in the next section, fertilizer adoption, an outcome
 prone to experimenter demand effects, seems to increase particularly for
 treated farmers that live close to an agro-input dealer.
 This finding reduces the possibility that results are driven by misreporting
 related to experimenter demand effects, as this would mean that households
 that have better access to improved inputs strategically decide to report
 their answers differently than households that have less access to inputs.

Maize is especially important in eastern Uganda.
 We sampled from five districts in eastern Uganda known for their maize
 production: Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo, and Namutumba.
 From these districts, we removed town councils and also two sub-counties
 that consisted of islands in lake Victoria.
 We used two-stage cluster sampling to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, from the five districts, we first selected 50 parishes randomly
 and in proportion to the number of villages within each parish.
 Within each village in the selected parishes, we then listed all households,
 from which we randomly selected 10 households to participate in the study.
 In each village, one of the 10 households was randomly allocated to the
 control group (which got to see a placebo video).
 The remaining 9 households were all shown a video.
 We then added the IVR treatment randomly to 2/3 of the households that
 were allocated to the video intervention and further randomly allocated
 1/2 of the households assigned to the IVR encouragement to the SMS treatment

More precisely, and as mentioned in footnote 1, this research was part of

 issues related to gender in agricultural extension.
 Because of this, we also experimentally varied who provided the information

 as to whom the video was shown within the household (a man alone, a woman

 In the context of a factorial design with two factors with each 3 levels,
 this corresponded to 9 treatment combinations.
 We thus used villages as blocs, and randomly assigned the nine potential
 treatment combinations to the 9 households in each village and the control
 placebo video treatment to a 10th hosuehold.
 We then added the IVR treatment randomly to 2/3 of the households in each
 of the nine treatment cells.
 Among those that were allocated the IVR in each treatment cell, we then
 randomly allocated 1/2 of households to the SMS treatment.
 As such, the treatment cells created by the interaction of the 2 other
 factors were used as blocs in the randomization of IVR and SMS treatments.

 In a different paper, we plan to use this part of the field experiment
 to learn about information flows within the household.
 While the research hypotheses related to these intra-household information
 transfer inefficiencies were conceptualized and implemented at the individual
 level, the research hypotheses related to the delivery mode analyzed here
 (video, video+IVR,video+IVR+SMS) were conceptualized and implemented at
 the household level (and dummies for who was shown the video were included
 in all regressions).

Answers of both spouses were used to construct household-level outcomes.
 For continuous variables, generally, a simple average was taken from responses
 provided by the two members.
 For binary outcomes, such as whether the household gained knowledge on
 a particular topic, we often assumed the household realized that outcome
 (e.g., knowledge) if at least one member indicated the correct answer.
 For adoption of a particular input or practice, we indicate that the household
 is considered an adopter if at least one household member adopts on at
 least one plot.
 While it would indeed be interesting to look at differences in reporting
 between spouses, this is more related to the research hypotheses that were

R2 - Review of “ICTs to Provide Agricultural Advice to Smallholder Farmers:
 Experimental Evidence from Uganda” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Summary: The paper investigates the potential of Information and Communication
 Technologies (ICTs) for agricultural extension.
 In particular, the authors test whether alternative ICTs can enhance farmers’
 knowledge of improved practices, increase the adoption of such practices,
 and improve yields.
 They set up a field experiment where a random group of farmers was assigned
 to a treatment group which received access to a video (screened on a tablet
 by an enumerator) with agricultural advice.
 Farmers in the treatment group were further split into two groups: one
 was part of an encouragement design to use an interactive voice response
 (IVR) technology and the other one was not.
 The encouragement design promoted farmers’ access to on-demand pre-recorded
 messages on their phones with the same agricultural advices as the video
 intervention.
 Additionally, a randomly selected subgroup of those in the encouragement
 group were assigned to receive eight text messages around the time of some
 important agricultural practices related to the overall extension campaign.
 This design allows the authors to test: (a) the impact of the video extension
 program, (b) the incremental effect of the IVR system, and (c) the additional
 impact of the text message reminders.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, they find that the video intervention increased farmers’ knowledge
 of practices, improved the likelihood of adopting recommended practices,
 and raised yields.
 However, they find that the IVR and text message components generated little
 further improvements in these outcomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
General Comment: I enjoyed reading the paper and believe it makes a useful
 contribution to the emerging literature on the role of ICTs in agricultural
 extension.
 In my view, its biggest contribution is testing the joint effectiveness
 of different types of ICTs (when most the available work focuses only on
 one).
 Methodologically, the authors are able to estimate causal estimates based
 on randomized assignment.
 They are also rigorous in their inference by using increasingly popular
 techniques (based on randomization inference and adjusting for family-wise
 error rates).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suggestions: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 The paper is based on a traditional theory of change for agricultural extension
: extension leads to improvements of knowledge, which increases adoption
 of improved practices and subsequently boosts yields.
 Along this line, the paper would benefit from better translating this theory
 of change into their outcomes.
 For example, the paper’s outcomes for knowledge are plant spacing, input
 combination, timing of weeding, and fall armyworm control.
 While they do include some of these concepts in their adoption outcomes
 (i.e., spacing and weeding), there are several others — timing of planting,
 management of striga (though somewhat related 1to weeding), fertilizer
 use, and seed choices — for which there no measures of knowledge gains.
 Including outcomes related to the same practices in their analysis of adoption
 and knowledge would lend more credibility to the mechanisms through which
 ICT-based extension improves farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Ultimately, a one-to-one correspondence between the knowledge questions
 and the adoption of specific technologies or practices was not entirely
 practicable within our design.
 Nonetheless, we appreciate the reviewer's insights on this.
 More importantly, we should point out that while the results are presented
 in a way that suggests a traditional theory of change in mind, where a
 lack of technical knowledge is the main constraint to increased modern
 input use or application of recommended practices, we are actually exploring
 other theories as part of this analysis.
 For example, there is an emerging body of research that explores the role
 of peer learning and inspiration in the context of model farmers, and our
 research was also informed by this.
 To explore this, our videos use actors that farmers can relate to, drawing
 on several recent studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "benyishay2018social,doi:10.1093/wber/lhv014"

\end_inset

.
 In such cases, it may be that the intervention does not affect knowledge
 (farmers may have prior knowledge about the technology but still not use
 it), yet we might still expect to see a change in behavior, e.g., adoption.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
In fact, for the additional interventions, and SMS in particular, these
 behavioural channels are assumed to be more important than the traditional
 theory of change.
 As no new information is given, we do not expect to see a lot of change
 in knowledge, but we do expect that farmers will change their behaviour.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Therefore, assessing changes in knowledge was subordinate to assessing
 changes in behavior.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Relatedly, we opted to measure knowledge on only four topics using 4 multiple
 choice questions.
 These four questions were carefully considered in light of the information
 provided in the video.
 One questions was on spacing.
 The recommendation we provided in the video was a new way of spacing with
 reduced seeding rate that was only recently being promoted by the government
 (spacing of 75cm x 30cm with 1 plant per hill).
 As this was new, we expected to find only few people in the control group
 would know this and that the intervention would significantly increase
 this knowledge.
 This, in turn, we hoped would increase the actual application of the new
 way of spacing.
 As such, this follows a traditional theory of change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The second question that was included is not so much about testing technical
 knowledge.
 It is more about testing if farmers understood the broader message given
 in the video that successful farmers generally see maize farming more as
 a business enterprise than as a means to provide food for the household.
 This question suggests impact works more through aspirational channels,
 testing if farmers understood the broader message given in the video that
 successful farmers generally see maize farming more as a business which
 requires foresight, planning, and risk taking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The third question was included to investigate how video can be used to
 make a known technology more salient.
 We knew from previous work in the region and from qualitative interviews
 that farmers are generally well aware about the optimal timing for first
 weeding, but few farmers actually do it.
 We wanted to investigate if simply repeating something that farmers already
 know is effective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The last questions was added to see if our information interventions would
 crowd in additional search for information.
 We did not provide any information about fall armyworm in our videos, IVR
 nor SMS messages.
 We thus also did not expect our interventions to have a direct effect on
 knowledge related to fighting fall armyworm.
 However, it could be that farmers that received information on recommended
 practices and modern inputs and shown stories of successful farmers start
 to look for information from various other sources.
 As fall armyworm was an important emerging problem at the time, we thought
 this would be a good topic.

Not all constraints to maize productivity improvement are information deficienci
es directly related to the use of inputs, technologies, and crop management
 practices.
 Often, missing information problems manifest indirectly, as uncertainty
 about the distribution of the farm-household's profit function.
 This includes uncertainty about the correlations between expected and actual
 returns, the inter-temporality of income streams, estimates of fixed and
 variable costs, hidden transactions costs, probabilities of adverse events,
 and a range of other variables that farmers may simply be unable to conceptuali
ze or measure.
 Thus, a significant portion of the videos also focuses on evaluating the
 costs and benefits of the different technologies and practices being promoted.
 In addition, the videos encourage long-term thinking, advising farmers
 to (a) start small and grow their farm enterprise over time, and (b) combine
 technologies and practices together rather than investing all of their
 money and effort into one single input, practice, or technology.

We also pay attention to how the information is packaged.
 For instance, prior studies have found that farmers find communicators
 who face agricultural conditions and constraints most comparable to their
 own to be the more persuasive than other communicators

 The paper would benefit from clarification of the research design.
 In particular, it would be useful to better understand why — in contrast
 to most recent field experiments on agricultural extension — the randomization
 was conducted at the individual rather than the village level.
 Information can flow easily between subjects and create externalities.
 While cluster randomization does not eliminate contamination of the control

 We thus used villages as blocs, and randomly assigned the nine potential
 treatment combinations to 9 households in each village and the control
 placebo video treatment to a 10th hosuehold.
 We then added the IVR treatment randomly to 2/3 of the households in each
 of the 9 treatment cells.
 Among those that were allocated the IVR in each treatment cell, we then
 randomly allocated 1/2 of households to the SMS treatment.
 As such, the treatment cells created by the interaction of the 2 other
 factors were used as blocs in the randomization of IVR and SMS treatments.

The authors find considerable impacts of their video intervention (especially
 for plant spacing), but no additional effects of the other ICTs (such as
 IVR).
 The IVR encouragement design was conducted through randomly providing some
 farmers with flyers incentivizing them to call a toll-free number and get
 agricultural information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can always argue that — if there are flows of information from the video
 to the control group — this would provide an underestimate of the treatment
 effect (given that it is already sizable and positive).
 But, the randomization strategy by itself may have a role to play in the
 IVR effect.
 Those with access to the extension videos may have shared the toll-free
 number with others.
 Because the video and IVR information have complementary effects (as implicitly
 assumed in the setup of the field experiment), those with information about
 the toll free number are more likely to have shared it with others that
 also had been in a video screening session.
 This would generate a downward bias of the treatment effect (which might
 be truly positive) of the IVR (consistent with the findings of the paper).
 Furthermore, text- message intervention was nested within the IVR encouragement
 design, this contamination can also downward bias the estimates of the
 text message campaign.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One potential way to address this is to use the random assignment to the
 IVR as an instrument for actually calling the toll free number.
 The authors do account for this possibility in the paper.
 However, the results are not shown, and the paper might benefit from presenting
 them.
 The authors find there were 430 unique calls, out of which 214 corresponded
 to phone numbers in the encouragement group (about 9% of the encouraged
 households).
 It is unclear how many of these unique calls could be traced to individuals
 in the experiment that were not part of this encouragement group.
 This could provide an idea of any contamination of the control group that
 could lead the ITT estimate downwards.
 It would also tell us how strong the first is and whether the instrument
 is relevant enough for an IV estimation.
 Additionally, the take-up in the encouraged group (9%) would suggest that
 the IV-treatment effect would correspond to the Intent-to-treat (ITT) scaled-up
 by a factor of 11 (potentially larger once we account for any potential
 take-up in the control group).
 This could lead to a different interpretation of the results if the IV
 estimates are large (even when not statistically significant).
 This information would help us better understand the IVR (and potentially
 the text message) results of the paper.
 Is it that the ITT is low due to contamination? Can we conclude that there
 are no effects of IVR? Are these effects sizable, but imprecise? Or should
 we just conclude that the demand was low (and there is not much more to
 say about this)?

We then reflect on potential reasons for the lack of impact.
 We examine take-up and using simple back-of-the-envelope calculations show
 the minimum detectable effect size and how it is affected by low compliance.

 as only 1 percent of households in the control group called the IVR.

We then discuss a particular concern with our measure of compliance.
 In particular, we suspect that our indicator of take-up of the intervention
 is likely to significantly underestimate true compliance.
 In particular, our indicator of compliance is taken from the IVR system
 log, where recorded telephone numbers are matched to phone numbers that
 were recorded during baseline data collection.
 This indicator is likely to severely under-report true compliance, as encourage
d farmers may have used different phones to call the IVR.

The fact that 430 unique calls to the system were recorded, representing
 about 18 percent of encouraged households, confirms this suspicion.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Using our measure of compliance, we cannot maintain the exclusion restriction
 holds, as some of the potential outcomes are directly determined by the
 instrument.
 The problem becomes apparent when we think about LATE as the Wald estimator
 that scales the ITT by compliance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "angrist_mostly_2008"

\end_inset

.
 In our case, the ITT will be estimated on the basis of all farmers encouraged
 to call in to the IVR system.
 Our measure of compliance forces the LATE estimation to work with the 214
 households that show up in the IVR log and could be identified in the baseline,
 rather than through the 430 farmers that called in, which in the case of
 a positive impact would lead to an overestimate of the impact of the treatment
 among compliers.
 It is well known that especially in the context of a weak first stage,
 the bias can become extremely large

 The authors report an attrition rate of 7.3%.
 Considering that the intervention only took place over a few months, this
 is quite large.
 While there is no differential attrition between treatment arms (in terms
 of rates and some selected characteristics), the authors could calculate
 bounds (Manski-type, Lee-type, or other) to determine how sensitive their
 estimates are to this problem.

 The only outcomes for which the paper finds any impact of the IVR platform
 are the ones related to the adoption of fertilizer (negative effect) and
 improved seeds (large and positive effect).
 Given the other results in the paper, this seems counterintuitive.
 The authors argue that “with access to a more demand-driven ICT channel,
 farmers that used organic fertilizer may seek information on more complex
 but efficient types of fertilizers” (p.26) and that “providing farmers with
 a tool that allows them to actively seek out information about a new input
 or technology increases the likelihood that they also adopt hybrid maize
 seed” (p 27).
 Based on the IVR-dial in codes (e.g., press “1” for recommendations about
 seeds, press “2” for recommendations about fertilizer”, etc.), can the authors
 show that these were topics for which farmers in the encouraged group actively
 demanded? This would lend credibility to the authors’ proposed interpretation
 of their estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
This is a useful suggestion.
 We find that among farmers that called the IVR service and selected the
 seed topic, 38 percent report that they used hybrid seed.
 This is 35 percent among those that called but did not select this topic.
 However, the difference is not statistically significant.
 Furthermore, 27 percent farmers that called the IVR system and selected
 to get information on soil health report that they use DAP/NPK; this is
 one percentage point lower for farmers that did not listen to this topic.
 In addition, 11 percent of farmers that listened to the soil health messages
 report using urea.
 Here, 7.6 percent of farmers that did not listen to this message report
 using urea.
 Also, use rates of organic fertilizer are higher among those that selected
 the topic in the IVR.
 Also here, none of the differences are significant.
 This is likely due to the fact that very few people called the IVR system.

 The paper’s results on input adoption are based on self-reported measures
 of input use (e.g., used urea / organic fertilizer / hybrid maize seed /
 open pollinated varieties in at least one plot).
 Is there any possibility to cross check this with other measures of input
 use (such as purchased quantities or expenditures in some inputs)? This
 can lend credibility to the results if we believe that mere report of any
 input use is more subject to social desirability bias than other (less
 direct) measures.
 The authors might also be able to estimate some back-of-the- envelope calculati
ons about plant spacing.
 For example, knowing the size of the area planted for maize and the total
 amount of seeds (improved or not), they could be able to estimate whether
 these quantities are consistent with a 75cm x 30cm spacing recommended
 by the intervention (at least for those who claim that hey followed this
 advice).

A key concern with this study is the use of self-reported survey data on
 key outcomes, as opposed to outcomes that are measured by a third party
 in an objective way.
 Study participants may report what they feel is desired in that context
 (social desirability bias).
 In an RCT, social desirability bias becomes a real concern if it is correlated
 to the treatment, which is sometimes referred to as experimenter demand
 effects

 less problematic than initially thought

 are unlikely to drive our results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
First, during the design of the endline questionnaire, we tried to minimize
 potential experimenter demand effects by careful formulation of the questions.
 Experimenter demand effects are more likely to be a concern for simple
 yes/no questions than for more open ended questions.
 For instance, in our endline survey, we did not ask if farmers used 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plant spacing of 75cm x 30cm with a reduced seed rate of 1 seed per hill
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as recommended.
 Rather, we asked farmers to describe the planting process, and the enumerator
 was then asked to select the appropriate response from a list of options
 that was not revealed to the farmer.
 For input adoption, we started from broad questions (eg.
 whether fertilizer was used on a particular plot) and then asked farmers
 to go further into detail (eg.
 asking about fertilizer type, timing of application, quantities and price)
 allowing enumerators to detect inconsistencies that may signal experimenter
 demand effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
Second, in our endline survey, not all outcomes are equally likely to be
 affected by experimenter demand effects.
 For instance, experimenter demand effects are probably less likely to be
 an issue for the multiple choice questions used to measure knowledge than
 for questions about implementation of recommended practices or the use
 of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer or improved seed.
 It is reassuring that there is consistency between effects found on questions
 that are more or less prone to experimenter demand effect.
 In other words, if we would have found that our interventions did not result
 in a change in knowledge related to optimal plant spacing, yet farmers
 report that they did use optimal plant spacing on their plots, we would
 be more worried that the latter effect was driven by experimenter demand
 effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
Third, as we will report in the next section, fertilizer adoption, an outcome
 prone to experimenter demand effects, seems to increase particularly for
 treated farmers that live close to an agro-input dealer.
 This finding reduces the possibility that results are driven by misreporting
 related to experimenter demand effects, as this would mean that households
 that have better access to improved inputs strategically decide to report
 their answers differently than households that have less access to inputs.

 The intervention promotes increased input use by aiming to increase farmers’
 demand for improved seeds and fertilizer.
 Demand can indeed increase the use of these inputs, but this effect will
 also depend on their availability or monetary constraints.
 In this line, the authors might want to estimate heterogeneous treatment
 effects of input use by baseline expenditures (or resource constraint proxies,
 if available) and by distance to nearest agro input dealer (included as
 a variable in Table 1).
 The results should, in theory, suggest larger impacts among wealthier household
s and among those closer to agro dealers.
 A finding along these lines would reduce the possibility that paper’s results
 are due to misreporting related to social desirability bias: we would need
 to believe in the unlikely possibility households that are wealthier or
 have better access to improved inputs strategically decide to report their
 answers differentially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
This is a good suggestion that is also related to requests for a in-depth
 exploration of heterogeneity in treatment effects (see R4.8).
 We have thus explored this as part of a more general analysis of heterogeneous
 treatment effects reported in Table

.
 Results indeed suggest that the positive impact of the video on the use
 of urea is particularly large for farmers that are relatively close to
 an input dealer (defined as less or equal than 5 km).
 At the same time, and consistent with the theoretical prediction of the
 reviewer, we do not find that the increase in organic fertilizer as a result
 to the video intervention is sensitive to distance to an input provider.
 It was harder to test for heterogeneous effects related to baseline resources,
 as we did not collect detailed data on consumption at baseline.
 We tried using different proxies for wealth (such the number of rooms scaled
 by the number of household members, area cultivated, whether the household
 had access to off-farm income,...), but we do not find that effects are different
 between the two groups.
 This may be because the income constraint is not binding - fertilizer can
 usually be obtained in small quantities.
 A similar finding applies to the IVR effect on hybrid seed.

 The paper suggests that the intervention increased yields: while there
 are no changes in total production, there are reductions in households’
 planted areas.
 The authors attribute this increase in yields to their recommendation to
 “start small” with the use of practices and inputs.
 A significant portion of the effect on knowledge and practices comes from
 recommendations on plant spacing.
 However, there are no increases in the respondents’ perceptions of better
 yields in the treatment group.
 So, another possibility is that, by making space more salient, they might
 have primed households to think more carefully about the total surface
 that they had planted (and this might lead to a reduction in their report
 about their planted areas).
 This would imply that their results would be driven by differential reporting,
 rather than actual increases in yields.
 Can the authors say something about this possibility?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We think it is unlikely that priming is responsible for the effect.
 The new spacing does not affect total area planted (and also does not affect
 the quantity of seed needed, see also your comment 5 above).
 Furthermore, we feel that there may be some issues with perception of better
 yields: Farmers may have confused yields with production.
 Consistent with our recommendation to start small and combine technologies
 and the results that yield effects are due to producing the same amounts
 on smaller plots, farmers may indicate that on the plot the same amount
 of maize was produced when part was left fallow or planted with another
 crop.

 As such, imbalance can not be responsible for the impact of the video intervent

\begin_layout Standard
Summary This study experimentally assesses the impact of ICT-based agricultural
 extension on knowledge, adoption of recommended technologies and practices,
 and agricultural production among maize farmers in Uganda.
 The main intervention consists of a video clip on maize farming delivered
 in person.
 The study also evaluates the additional effects of an IVR hotline service
 offering an interactive menu-based information service on the same set
 of agricultural topics, and a series of SMS messages providing the same
 advice timed appropriately throughout the agricultural season.
 Using the survey data, the authors find that the video intervention increased
 relevant agricultural knowledge and the likelihood of adopting recommended
 practices, leading to a 10% increase in maize yield (kg/acre), whereas
 the additional effects of IVR and SMS interventions were insignificant.

 The remaining 9 households were all shown a video.
 We then added the IVR treatment randomly to 2/3 of the households that
 were allocated to the video intervention and further randomly allocated
 1/2 of these households to the SMS treatment

More precisely, and as mentioned in footnote 1, this research was part of
 a larger research project that also used the video intervention to explore
 issues related to gender in agricultural extension.
 Because of this, we also experimentally varied who provided the information
 in the video (a man alone, a woman alone, or a couple (man+woman)) as well
 as to whom the video was shown within the household (a man alone, a woman
 alone, or a couple (man+woman)).
 In the context of a factorial design with two factors with each 3 levels,
 this corresponded to 9 treatment combinations.
 We thus used villages as blocs, and randomly assigned the nine potential
 treatment combinations to the remaining 9 households in each village.
 We then added the IVR treatment randomly to 2/3 of the households in each
 treatment cell.
 Among those that were allocated the IVR in each treatment cell, we then
 randomly allocated 1/2 of households to the SMS treatment.
 As such, the treatment cells created by the interaction of the 2 other
 factors were used as blocs in the randomization of IVR and SMS treatments.
 The exact same sampling procedure was used in the permutation algorithm
 that was used to judge significance through randomization inference.

 What was the rationale for surveying two people from each household at

 by design? The authors explained that the best response was taken for the
 knowledge outcomes and the means were taken for the production outcomes.
 What about the adoption measures? The gender role in agricultural decision-maki

 diffusion of information within the household.
 In particular, the screening of the video itself was also randomized into
 three 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

treatment arms
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 (see also your previous comment).
 In 1/3 of households that were allocated to the video treatment, the man
 alone in the household was shown the video.
 In another 1/3, the video was shown to the woman alone within the household.In
 the final 1/3, the video was shown to the couple (man+woman) together.
 In a different paper, we plan to use this part of the field experiment
 to learn about information flows within the household.
 While the research hypotheses related to these intra-household information
 transfer inefficiencies were conceptualized and implemented at the individual
 level, the research hypotheses related to the delivery mode (video, video+IVR,v
ideo+IVR+SMS) was conceptualized and implemented at the household level
 (and dummies for who was shown the video was included in all regressions).
 For more information about the design of the entire project and how the
 different factors were integrated into a 3 by 3 full factorial design,
 we refer readers to the pre-analysis plan.
 We feel an elaborate explanation of these design specificities in the paper
 may lead to confusion.

Answers of both spouses were used to construct household-level outcomes.
 For continuous variables, generally, a simple average was taken between
 the two members.
 For binary outcomes, such as whether the household gained knowledge on
 a particular topic, we assumed the household learned if at least one member
 indicated the correct answer.
 For adoption of a particular practice of input, we indicate that the household
 adopts if at least one household member reports adopting on at least one
 plot (consistent with how it is done in

Outcomes measures - I have several concerns about how the outcomes were
 selected and constructed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 The selection of measures used for knowledge and recommended practices
 seem somewhat arbitrary.
 For example, the knowledge section includes a question about practices
 on managing fall armyworms, but there is no adoption measure that corresponds
 to this question.
 Similarly, adoption measures include the timing of planning and removing
 striga, but there are no corresponding questions in the knowledge section.
 Do these analyses use all of the relevant questions asked in the survey?
 If yes, how were they selected at the stage of survey development? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
This question is similar to the first concern of reviewer 2 (R2.1), and is
 well taken.
 Ultimately, close correspondence between the knowledge questions and the
 adoption of specific technologies or practices was not entirely practicable
 within our design.
 Note, however, that while the results are presented in a way that suggests
 a traditional theory of change(in which a lack of technical knowledge is
 the main constraint to increased modern input use or application of recommended
 practices), we are actually exploring other theories as part of this analysis.
 Specificially, we draw on the emerging body of research on alternative
 impact pathways such as peer learning and inspirational role models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "benyishay2018social,doi:10.1093/wber/lhv014"

\end_inset

.
 In such cases, it may be that the intervention does not affect knowledge
 (farmers may know the technology but not apply it), yet we would expect
 a change in behavior.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
In fact, for the additional interventions, and SMS in particular, these
 behavioural channels are assumed to be more important than the traditional
 theory of change.
 As no new information is given, we do not expect to see a lot of change
 in knowledge, but we do expect that farmers will change their behaviour.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Therefore, assessing changes in knowledge was subordinate to assessing
 changes in behavior and we opted to measure knowledge on only four topics
 using 4 multiple choice questions.
 As a result, there is no one-on-one correspondence between the knowledge
 questions and the recommendations and practices, and it may appear the
 knowledge questions are chosen somewhat arbitrary.
 However, these four questions were carefully though about.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

One questions was on spacing.
 The recommendation we provided in the video was a new way of spacing with
 reduced seeding rate that was only recently being promoted by the government
 (spacing of 75cm x 30cm with 1 plant per hill).
 As this was new, we expected to find only few people in the control group
 would know this and that the intervention would significantly increase
 this knowledge.
 This, in turn, we hoped would increase the actual application of the new
 way of spacing.
 As such, this follows a traditional theory of change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The second question that was included is not so much about testing technical
 knowledge.
 It is more about testing if farmers understood the broader message given
 in the video that successful farmers generally see maize farming more as
 a business enterprise than as a means to provide food for the household.
 This question suggests impact works more through aspirational channels,
 testing if farmers understood the broader message given in the video that
 successful farmers generally see maize farming more as a business which
 requires foresight, planning, and risk taking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The third question was included to investigate how video can be used to
 make a known technology more salient.
 We knew from previous work in the region and from qualitative interviews
 that farmers are generally well aware about the optimal timing for first
 weeding, but few farmers actually do it.
 We wanted to investigate if simply repeating something that farmers already
 know is effective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The last questions was added to see if our information interventions would
 crowd in additional search for information.
 We did not provide any information about fall armyworm in our videos, IVR
 nor SMS messages.
 We thus also did not expect our interventions to have a direct effect on
 knowledge related to fighting fall armyworm.
 However, it could be that farmers that received information on recommended
 practices and modern inputs and shown stories of successful farmers start
 to look for information from various other sources.
 As fall armyworm was an important emerging problem at the time, we thought
 this would be a good topic.

 The authors mention in the text that three fertilizers (DAP/NPK, Urea,
 and organic fertilizers) were recommended separately in the video.
 And yet, upon reporting the negative treatment effect on the first fertilizer
 type (DAP/NPK), they decide to create an index that takes non-adoption
 of DAP/NPK as a positive outcome and explains that there was an additional
 recommendation to promote balanced input usage.
 This seems inappropriate: one would expect that the promotion of balanced
 input usage would lead to an increased likelihood of adopting every input
 (perhaps at a lower quantity), rather than decreased adoption of one of
 the three recommended fertilizers.

 the index.

A key concern with this study is the use of self-reported survey data on
 key outcomes, as opposed to outcomes that are measured by a third party
 in an objective way.
 Study participants may report what they feel is desired in that context
 (social desirability bias).
 In an RCT, social desirability bias becomes a real concern if it is correlated
 to the treatment, which is sometimes referred to as experimenter demand
 effects

 less problematic than initially thought 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

before "eg."

\end_inset

, we provide some discussion on why we feel experimenter demand effects
 are unlikely to drive our results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
First, during the design of the endline questionnaire, we tried to minimize
 potential experimenter demand effects by careful formulation of the questions.
 Experimenter demand effects are more likely to be a concern for simple
 yes/no questions than for more open ended questions.
 For instance, in our endline survey, we did not ask if farmers used 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plant spacing of 75cm x 30cm with a reduced seed rate of 1 seed per hill
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as recommended.
 Rather, we asked farmers to describe the planting process, and the enumerator
 was then asked to select the appropriate response from a list of options
 that was not revealed to the farmer.
 For input adoption, we started from broad questions (eg.
 whether fertilizer was used on a particular plot) and then asked farmers
 to go further into detail (eg.
 asking about fertilizer type, timing of application, quantities and price)
 allowing enumerators to detect inconsistencies that may signal experimenter
 demand effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
Second, in our endline survey, not all outcomes are equally likely to be
 affected by experimenter demand effects.
 For instance, experimenter demand effects are probably less likely to be
 an issue for the multiple choice questions used to measure knowledge than
 for questions about implementation of recommended practices or the use
 of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer or improved seed.
 It is reassuring that there is consistency between effects found on questions
 that are more or less prone to experimenter demand effect.
 In other words, if we would have found that our interventions did not result
 in a change in knowledge related to optimal plant spacing, yet farmers
 report that they did use optimal plant spacing on their plots, we would
 be more worried that the latter effect was driven by experimenter demand
 effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
Third, as we will report in the next section, fertilizer adoption, an outcome
 prone to experimenter demand effects, seems to increase particularly for
 treated farmers that live close to an agro-input dealer.
 This finding reduces the possibility that results are driven by misreporting
 related to experimenter demand effects, as this would mean that households
 that have better access to improved inputs strategically decide to report
 their answers differently than households that have less access to inputs.

8.The authors equate insignificant results with no impact.
 However, the study sample may be too small to capture small effects on
 noisy agricultural outcomes.
 Given the observed variance of maize yield, what is the minimum detectable
 effect size? Is it possible that some of the analyses are underpowered?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
While we believe that the original design was generously powered (an elaborate
 series of power simulations can be found in the pre-analysis plan), we
 agree that low take-up may have attenuated the ITT effects for the incremental
 IVR and SMS treatments.
 We estimate Local Average Treatment Effects to account for partial compliance,
 but it is well known that the IV estimator loses power quickly even with
 moderate non-compliance

Thus, even after accounting for non-compliance, we find that additional
 effects from the IVR treatment are limited, particularly when judged by
 outcome indices.
 A first reason why we fail to find significant effects that are consistent
 with the effects from the video for the additional treatment may be because
 the partial compliance greatly reduces the power of the design.
 Only 8.9 percent of households that were selected for the IVR treatment
 also actually called in

 Contamination, where farmers that were allocated to the control group end

 It is not surprising that the additional effects of IVR access is small
 given that < 10% of farmers called in.
 It is possible that this intervention was not well-designed: IVR is not
 a familiar technology among the study population.
 Access to the hotline service that requires self-navigation without an
 appropriate training on how to use it may have attenuated the impact in
 this particular study.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
This is a possible explanation, although we would not call this a poorly
 designed study per se.
 The idea was to test the incremental effectiveness of a particular IVR
 (as implemented by Viamo).
 This model assumes no training is needed, and our implementing partner
 for the IVR treatment (Viamo) has extensive experience in designing and
 implementing IVR services in developing countries without user training.
 Indeed, we were cautious about how to design the IVR approach in a manner
 that made practical sense, and were cognizant of the possibility that few
 farmers would call in.
 Indeed, many IVR services take low use rates as a given, but rely on the
 low cost of reaching large populations to make their service viable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
In our context, the first time a farmer dials in, he/she gets information
 on how to use the system, and the underlying assumption is that this should
 be sufficient for a typical farmer to use the system.
 The messages are also designed by experts in ways that make it attractive
 and comprehensible to the average farmer.
 It may indeed be that different effects would have been found if a different
 version of an IVR would have been tested (eg.
 with dedicated training sessions).
 However, testing different versions of the IVR service was not the aim
 of this study.

This is a good suggestion, also noted by reviewer 2 (R2.4).
 We find that among farmers that called the IVR service and selected the
 seed topic, 38 percent report that they used hybrid seed.
 This is 35 percent among those that called but did not select this topic.
 However, the difference is not statistically significant.
 Furthermore, 27 percent farmers that called the IVR system and selected
 to get information on soil health report that they use DAP/NPK; this is
 one percentage point lower for farmers that did not listen to this topic.
 In addition, 11 percent of farmers that listened to the soil health messages
 report using urea.
 Here, 7.6 percent of farmers that did not listen to this message report
 using urea.
 Also, use rates of organic fertilizer are higher among those that selected
 the topic in the IVR.
 Also here, none of the differences are significant.
 This is likely due to the fact that very few people called the IVR system.

 the expected change in profit for the average farmer due to the video intervent

 Estimation of cost-benefits at the farmer level are then used as input

Cost-effectiveness and scalability are often major selling points for interventi
ons such as the ones being tested.
 While we did not collect detailed information on prices paid for inputs
 or the cost of labour, we can use the estimates above together with aggregate
 price data and some assumptions in a series of back-of-the-envelope cost
 and benefit calculations.
 We first check if the video intervention affected profitability of the
 average farmer and then compare the total cost of the intervention to the
 total benefit derived by the farmers in our study.

In our sample, a bag of 100 kg of maize was sold at a median price of UGX
 60,000.
 We have seen that a control household reported yields of 430 kg per acre,
 with a corresponding value of UGX 258,000.
 In the sub-sample that received the video treatment, yields increased to
 475 kg per acre, corresponding to UGX 285,000.
 This means a difference in income of UGX 27,000 per acre, or about 7.7 USD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
From this, we subtract the cost of inputs.
 In the intervention, we recommended two hybrid seed types, Longe 10H and
 UH5354 (commonly known as Bazooka).
 At the time of the experiment, Longe 10H sold for UGX 6,000 per kg, while
 Bazooka costed UGX 8,500 per kg.
 However, the data shows that the use of Bazooka was marginal and not correlated
 to the treatment.
 We will therefor use only the price of Longe 10H in the cost calculations.
 We further recommended two open-pollinated varieties: Longe 5 and Longe
 4.
 Among these two, Longe 5 is the most common variety.
 Both types costed about UGX 3,000 per kg.
 A farmer needs about 8 kg of seed to plant one acre.
 Inorganic fertilizers are probably the largest cost.
 The retail price of 1 kg of urea was about UGX 2,500, while DAP costed
 UGX 3,000 per kilo.
 We recommended using 60 kg of both DAP and Urea on one acre.
 We assume that organic fertilizer is free, but may increase labour cost
 (see below).
 The spacing and seed rate we recommend in the intervention is unlikely
 to increase the costs of seed.
 We recommend a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with one seeds per hill.
 Most farmers would use 75cm x 60cm with two seeds per hill, leading to
 the same amount of seed needed per unit of land.
 We thus simply multiply the cost of these inputs by the likelihood that
 they were applied in both control and treatment group (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

) and subtract this from the income obtained from maize.
 Doing so actually increases the difference in income between treatment
 and control somewhat, as the likelihood that farmers use the more expensive
 fertilizer DAP reduced somewhat, while the likelihood that farmers use
 Urea increased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
Changes in the cost of labour are harder to value.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_h1_ag"

\end_inset

 shows an increase in the practice of removing striga early on, which is
 likely to increase labour.
 The new spacing recommendation also means more hills are needed, which
 may also have an impact on labour, as does the increased use of organic
 fertilizer.
 At the same time, in our endline data, we do not find that the video treatment
 is significantly correlated to the time spent on preparing the land (which
 includes application of inorganic fertilizer), to time spend on weeding,
 nor to the likelihood that labor is hired in.
 In addition, labour is very cheap (6,000 per day).
 Valuing work related to organic fertilizer adoption at 3 days, the adoption
 of the new planting method at 2 days and the work for weeding at 10 days
 (which is the time needed to weed one acre), the difference in profit between
 treatment and control reduces to 22,464 or about 6.5 USD.

The intervention costed close to USD 37,000.
 Almost 40 percent of this are fixed costs such as the production of the
 video (USD 6,300) and the cost of procuring 20 tablets at a total cost
 of USD 5,600.
 We also needed to train the enumerators at a total cost of USD 2,224.
 Variable costs are estimated to be about USD 2.77 for a single screening
 to an average farmer in the area.
 This includes time for the personnel showing the video and supervision
 time, car hire with driver, and fuel needed to reach the households.
 As a result, the intervention as implemented would only break even at about
 15,000 observations.
 If the intervention is rolled out to all 360,000 households in the 5 districts
 where the intervention was piloted, the internal rate of return would be
 about 16 %

It may be possible to reduce variable costs considerably.
 The largest component of the variable cost was the cost of the person showing
 the videos to individual households.
 Currently, an extension worker with a bachelor's degree costs about the
 same of what we paid our enumerators (UGX 100,000 per day).
 One may argue that one does not need to have a university degree to show
 a video, in which case extension workers with only a diploma can be used
 at roughly UGX 77,000 per day.
 This would bring the variable cost down to about USD 2.36 for a single screening
 to the average farmer.
 Other cost savings may be obtained by showing videos to groups of farmers
 instead of individually, or direct streaming of videos to devices of farmers.
 However, this touches upon potentially important design features of the
 intervention than may alter outcomes, and as such require additional testing.

 (i) a video intervention is supply-driven and may be more appropriate in
 introducing a new technology but tends to be a one- off intervention, (ii)
 an IVR hotline is a demand-driven service, and (iii) SMS messages tend
 to be “too short to provide detailed information” but can be appropriately
 timed and hence could address behavioral constraints.
 It is plausible that the particular interventions evaluated in this study
 can be characterized as above.
 However, these technologies can be used to address various constraints
 in different settings, and the above assumptions may or may not apply to
 other settings.

 There are numerous assumptions here that may or may not be true.
 Videos are used by some organizations as a medium of information dissemination
 delivered at regular frequencies.
 As smartphone ownership increases, it will also become more accessible.
 Other organizations are delivering information on new technologies and
 agricultural practices via SMS messages.

\begin_layout Standard

 All of these points together highlight the importance of a more thoughtful
 discussion and the interpretation of the observed results.
 The conclusion of the current manuscript – that the video intervention
 improved knowledge, practices, and production, and other lighter-touch
 interventions had no additional effects – seems hasty.

We address these three related points together.
 They are similar to the first comment of reviewer 1 (R1.1), in that we may
 be misleading the reader by characterizing the interventions in a particular

 who similarly notes that others are using SMS messages to provide new agricultu

We agree that the components are developed in a particular way, and that
 may differ from how the technologies can be used in other settings.
 Our objective was to test a comprehensive ICT-mediated extension package
 consisting of different components each with its own characteristics.
 The different components of the intervention, and the incremental way in
 which they were implemented in the experiment, are the result of careful
 analysis of the situation in Uganda (low levels of knowledge on modern
 inputs due to a defunct public extension system, various start-ups experimentin
g with demand-driven initiatives such as WeFarm, DrumNet, Viamo, etc.
 ), as well as state of the art in the literature (the aspirations literature
 and importance of role models, reminders as nudges, etc.).
 With these points in min, we decided to start from a general baseline intervent
ion designed to make farmers aware of the most important new technologies
 and recommended practices.
 We hypothesized that the success of such messaging would depend partly
 on their provision in an appealing and accessible manner that was specifically
 tailored to less-educated farmers.
 Hence the idea to create a video.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
However, we also know from our contextual analysis that farmers who view
 a video only two times at the beginning of the maize growing season may
 forget some of the details that are explained in the video (for instance
 the name of a particular maize hybrid, the exact quantity of a particular
 type of inorganic fertilizer, etc.).
 Therefore, we wanted to add an information source for farmers that is accessibl
e on demand (but with exactly the same information, to rule out that any
 additional effect could be attributed to the content).
 The idea that IVR is used to provide more precise information on a particular
 technology means that farmers already need to have an idea of the existence
 of the particular technology.

This article investigates the effectiveness of an ICT-mediated extension
 approach designed to provide information about improved maize cultivation
 practices to smallholder farmers in Uganda.
 The approach consisting of three complementary information technologies,
 tested in an incremental design.
 First, we look at the effectiveness of short audiovisual messages that
 provide detailed information on how to improve maize cultivation, that
 were shown to farmers on tablet computers.
 The strength of video is that it can combine audio and visual information
 in an attractive way that is recognizable to the potentially illiterate
 farmer.
 Second, we add an IVR service with the same information.
 In an IVR system, a farmer calls a phone number and navigates through a
 menu to select a topic.
 The farmer then gets to listen to a pre-recorded message with information
 on the selected topic.
 The decision to make the same information available in the form of an on-demand
 service is motivated by the fact that farmers may easily forget some of
 the details of the video.
 Third, we add SMS messages that remind farmers at particular points in
 time during the maize growing season about key farming practices shown
 in the video and available on demand in the IVR system, as often information
 alone is insufficient to change behaviour.
 Timely reminders have been found very effective in overcoming inertia,
 procrastination, competing obligations, or simple forgetfulness of human
 beings

In light of this, we have also rewritten the conclusion, where we now employ
 a much more prudent approach, and discuss some of the reasons why we did
 not find additional effects for the IVR and SMS interventions (as we discuss
 in the section on additional analysis that the low uptake and an issue
 related to how we measure compliance is likely to be too problematic to
 establish a null effect).

 Estimation method does not include fixed effects or clustering at the geographi
c level.
 Access to extension agents, inputs, and soil characteristics may vary significa
ntly across villages and parishes.
 It would seem appropriate to use fixed effects at the geographic level.
 Furthermore, farmers within a village would be more likely to share information
 or learn from each other than farmers across villages: clustering at the
 village level may be appropriate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Our intervention is randomized at the individual level, and it is our understand
ing that in such cases, clustering is not needed.
 However, you are right to point out that particular design features of
 the study, such as the way the sample was drawn (two stage cluster sampling)
 and the randomization performed (blocking on village), would normally lead
 researchers to use fixed effects.
 Instead of using fixed effects (which is also controversial, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) or clustering, we use randomization inference throughout.
 The permutation algorithm that was developed for this paper mimics the
 design features of the study; one does not have to control for this ex-post.
 We refer to the eloquent description of randomization inference by Jed
 Friedman that makes this point

Randomization inference (RI) switches the inferential basis of statistical
 testing from the standard thought experiment of (repeatedly) drawing samples
 of observations from a larger known population to a thought experiment
 where the population is fixed to what is observed in the data, but treatment
 assignation itself is imagined to be repeatedly sampled.
 In this approach, the treatment value is the only random variable in the
 data and randomization creates the reference distribution of test statistics.
 All observed outcomes and covariates are assumed fixed.

 The sample size for the attrition table is so small that this analysis
 would be underpowered to detect any differential attrition.
 I would run a different analysis with a full sample regressing the indicator
 for completing the follow-up survey on treatment indicators, a vector of
 baseline characteristics, treatment indicators, and interactions between
 the two sets of variables.
 Joint significance across the interaction terms for each treatment indicator
 would provide a better sense on differential attrition.

Table

 presents a summary of a series of tests we did to investigate differential
 attrition.
 They relate to a series of regressions where an indicator of attrition
 is regressed upon treatment indicators and interactions with baseline character
istics.
 The first row looks at differential attrition among treatment groups.
 The first column compares attrition between the control group and households
 that received the video intervention.
 A t-test shows no significant difference in attrition between these two
 groups.
 The second column compares households that (also) received the encouragement
 treatment to those that did not (the control group and the video only group).
 Also here, there is no difference in attrition.
 We then compare attrition among the group that was allocated to the SMS
 treatment to those that were not and again find no significant difference.
 In the final column, we implement a joint test of differential attrition
 across the treatment groups.
 We do so by running a regression of the attrition indicator on dummy variables
 for the three treatments and test if all estimated coefficients are jointly
 zero.
 An F-test shows we can not reject the hypothesis of no differential attrition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We further investigate if attrition rates are correlated to baseline characteris
tics and whether this correlation differs by treatment group.
 Here the base specification regresses an indicator of attrition on a treatment
 indicator, the baseline characteristic under consideration, and the interaction
 between the treatment indicator and the baseline characteristic.
 We then test if the interaction between treatment and baseline characteristic
 is significantly different from zero using a t-test.
 For instance in the first column of the second row, we do not find that
 attrition rates are related to baseline yields among households that received
 the video intervention.
 In the second column of the second row, we also confirm that attrition
 rates are unrelated to baseline yields among households that received the
 IVR encouragement.
 The third column implements a similar test for the SMS subgroup.
 Finally, in the last column, we test if coefficients on yield interacted
 with all treatment dummies is jointly different from zero using an F-test.
 Also here, balance can not be rejected.
 These series of tests are repeated for each of the baseline characteristics
 that were included in Table

on with the video dummy (column 1), with the IVR dummy (column 2), with
 the SMS dummy (column 3) and with all three treatment dummies jointly (column
 4) are reported.
 Overall, we find that attrition is unrelated to the treatment and also
 unrelated to baseline characteristics, except perhaps for having received
 extension at baseline.

 Agricultural Advice to Smallholder Farmers: Experimental Evidence From
 Uganda” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper reports the results of a randomized control trial carried out
 in Uganda, evaluating the effectiveness of delivering agricultural messages
 through agricultural extension videos, coupled with SMS and IVR, on farmers’
 knowledge, agricultural practices, and yields.
 Relative to a counterfactual group the authors find increases in knowledge
 and increases in (self-reported) recommended practices and inputs and a
 ten percent increase in yields.
 The authors do not find evidence to suggest that adding SMS or IVR messages
 on top of the videos changed outcomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper describes a clean RCT carried out with a representative sample
 of almost 4,000 farmers in Uganda.
 The results provide evidence that informational frictions can limit farmer
 adoption of inputs and show the causal effects of information bundles,
 delivered through different ICTs on farmer behavior.
 The paper is clear, but I think it could be more precise about what the
 interventions are and what we can learn about them.
 Below, I list a number of issues which I think need to be addressed.

Main Comments:

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 You motivate the study by saying that one of the advantages of using ICTs
 over traditional extension methods is that ICTs can be cost-effective and
 scalable.
 However, it is not immediately clear how cost-effective/scalable your video
 intervention is if it depends on field officers/extension agents visiting
 farmers.
 If the argument is that this is an evaluation of a policy-relevant approach,
 then this requires a more thorough discussion on the pros/cons of this
 technology and how relevant it is as a policy option.
 A cost-effectiveness analysis would also be important.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We agree that cost-effectiveness and scalability are big selling points
 for intervention such as the one being tested.
 This is also mentioned by reviewer 3 who notes that showing videos to individua
l farmers can be costly (R3.12).
 In addition, this comment is related to the second remark of the first
 reviewer (R1.2) who wanted to know how the intervention affects the profitabilit
y of maize cultivation.
 We thus added a section on cost-effectiveness that starts by calculating
 the expected change in profit for the average farmer due to the video intervent
ion (as we find limited effects of the IVR and SMS treatments).
 Estimation of costs and benefits at the farmer level are then used as input
 to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

Cost-effectiveness and scalability are often major selling points for interventi
ons such as the ones being tested.
 While we did not collect detailed information on prices paid for inputs
 or the cost of labour, we can use the estimates above together with aggregate
 price data and some assumptions in a series of back-of-the-envelope cost
 and benefit calculations.
 We first check if the video intervention affected profitability of the
 average farmer and then compare the total cost of the intervention to the
 total benefit derived by the farmers in our study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
In our sample, a bag of 100 kg of maize was sold at a median price of UGX
 60,000.
 We have seen that a control household reported yields of 430 kg per acre,
 with a corresponding value of UGX 258,000.
 In the sub-sample that received the video treatment, yields increased to
 475 kg per acre, corresponding to UGX 285,000.
 This means a difference in income of UGX 27,000 per acre, or about 7.7 USD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
From this, we subtract the cost of inputs.
 In the intervention, we recommended two hybrid seed types, Longe 10H and
 UH5354 (commonly known as Bazooka).
 At the time of the experiment, Longe 10H sold for UGX 6,000 per kg, while
 Bazooka costed UGX 8,500 per kg.
 However, the data shows that the use of Bazooka was marginal and not correlated
 to the treatment.
 We will therefor use only the price of Longe 10H in the cost calculations.
 We further recommended two open-pollinated varieties: Longe 5 and Longe
 4.
 Among these two, Longe 5 is the most common variety.
 Both types costed about UGX 3,000 per kg.
 A farmer needs about 8 kg of seed to plant one acre.
 Inorganic fertilizers are probably the largest cost.
 The retail price of 1 kg of urea was about UGX 2,500, while DAP costed
 UGX 3,000 per kilo.
 We recommended using 60 kg of both DAP and Urea on one acre.
 We assume that organic fertilizer is free, but may increase labour cost
 (see below).
 The spacing and seed rate we recommend in the intervention is unlikely
 to increase the costs of seed.
 We recommend a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with one seeds per hill.
 Most farmers would use 75cm x 60cm with two seeds per hill, leading to
 the same amount of seed needed per unit of land.
 We thus simply multiply the cost of these inputs by the likelihood that
 they were applied in both control and treatment group (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

) and subtract this from the income obtained from maize.
 Doing so actually increases the difference in income between treatment
 and control somewhat, as the likelihood that farmers use the more expensive
 fertilizer DAP reduced somewhat, while the likelihood that farmers use
 Urea increased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
Changes in the cost of labour are harder to value.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_h1_ag"

\end_inset

 shows an increase in the practice of removing striga early on, which is
 likely to increase labour.
 The new spacing recommendation also means more hills are needed, which
 may also have an impact on labour, as does the increased use of organic
 fertilizer.
 At the same time, in our endline data, we do not find that the video treatment
 is significantly correlated to the time spent on preparing the land (which
 includes application of inorganic fertilizer), to time spend on weeding,
 nor to the likelihood that labor is hired in.
 In addition, labour is very cheap (6,000 per day).
 Valuing work related to organic fertilizer adoption at 3 days, the adoption
 of the new planting method at 2 days and the work for weeding at 10 days
 (which is the time needed to weed one acre), the difference in profit between
 treatment and control reduces to 22,464 or about 6.5 USD.

The intervention costed close to USD 37,000.
 Almost 40 percent of this are fixed costs such as the production of the
 video (USD 6,300) and the cost of procuring 20 tablets at a total cost
 of USD 5,600.
 We also needed to train the enumerators at a total cost of USD 2,224.
 Variable costs are estimated to be about USD 2.77 for a single screening
 to an average farmer in the area.
 This includes time for the personnel showing the video and supervision
 time, car hire with driver, and fuel needed to reach the households.
 As a result, the intervention as implemented would only break even at about
 15,000 observations.
 If the intervention is rolled out to all 360,000 households in the 5 districts
 where the intervention was piloted, the internal rate of return would be
 about 16 %
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
It may be possible to reduce variable costs considerably.
 The largest component of the variable cost was the cost of the person showing
 the videos to individual households.
 Currently, an extension worker with a bachelor's degree costs about the
 same of what we paid our enumerators (UGX 100,000 per day).
 One may argue that one does not need to have a university degree to show
 a video, in which case extension workers with only a diploma can be used
 at roughly UGX 77,000 per day.
 This would bring the variable cost down to about USD 2.36 for a single screening
 to the average farmer.
 Other cost savings may be obtained by showing videos to groups of farmers
 instead of individually, or direct streaming of videos to devices of farmers.
 However, this touches upon potentially important design features of the
 intervention than may alter outcomes, and as such require additional testing.

 You should explain in more detail why studying the additional value of
 IVR and SMS over videos is relevant in the context of your actual experiment.
 Policy-wise, it might have been more natural to test each technology separately
 or to start with the cheapest technology and then add the other ones.
 You argue that with this design you might address other constraints that
 could be better addressed through SMS and IVR (e.g.
 need for reminders, or continuous access to information during shocks).
 However, you need to convince us that these additional services were not
 just offering the same information that farmers already had but that they
 were actually addressing these other constraints you discuss.
 For example, I worry that the two SMS examples you provide sound more like
 general information rather than the types of reminder/nudges that you describe
 in your introduction (e.g.
 “weed your maize”).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, I suggest you tie your conceptual description of the rationale
 for these interventions with the description of the actual features of
 your intervention more closely.
 Otherwise, it is difficult to learn anything from the null effects of these
 other technologies (e.g.
 were the hypothesized constraints not binding? was the information provided
 not targeting those constraints? would we have expected effects had farmers
 suffered a shock? Or over additional seasons? etc.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We agree that the manuscript did not clearly explain the rationale behind
 the particular intervention, raising questions about why we test this in
 an incremental way and why we start with what is probably the most expensive
 component of the three.
 However, the different components of the intervention, and the incremental
 way in which they were implemented in the experiment, are the result of
 careful analysis of the situation in Uganda (low levels of knowledge on
 modern input due to a near-defunct public extension system, various start-ups
 experimenting with demand-driven initiatives such as WeFarm, DrumNet, Viamo,
 etc.) as well as state of the art in the literature (the aspirations literature
 and importance of role models, reminders as nudges, etc.).
 With these points in mind, we decided we needed to start from a general
 baseline intervention designed to make farmers aware of the most important
 new technologies and recommended practices.
 This messages should be brought in an appealing way and also accessible
 to low educated farmers.
 Hence the idea to create a video.

 Relatedly, the paper emphasizes the different technologies used to deliver
 information (SMS, IVR and videos).
 If the claim is that they are serving different needs, then you need to
 emphasize how the interventions differed from each other beyond the ICTs
 used to deliver them.
 In particular, you should spend more time discussing the differences in
 content and how these interventions were implemented.
 For example, a big difference between interventions is that for the videos
 all the farmers were individually visited at home whereas IVR was offered
 through an encouragement design.

 Now that we have improved the explanation of the rationale behind the intervent

 We tried as much as possible to keep the content fixed: only the delivery
 of the content was varied.
 In the video intervention, a model farmer explained in an attractive way
 what was needed to become a successful maize farmer.
 The same information could be obtained by dialing into the IVR.
 The SMS messages similarly reinforced the same information, did not provide
 new information, and covered all of the important technologies or practices
 that were also featured in the video and IVR.
 In other words, we tried as much as possible to keep content fixed to rule
 out that any additional effect could be attributed to the content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

We do not think there is a substantial difference between the video and
 IVR in that in the former, farmers were visited at home and the latter
 consisted of an encouragement.
 The encouragement was also administered individually (at the same time
 as the video was shown).
 It is true that video is supply-driven and IVR is demand-driven, but we
 have removed this distinction as a key motivation underlying our study
 in response to several reviewer comments.

In general, you should provide a more thorough description detailing what
 exactly was the information delivered (e.g.
 how specific/broad was the advice? was the same advice given to all farmers?
 what were all reminders about?), and how were these services implemented
 (e.g.
 who visited the farmers? what were the protocols to invite farmers? could
 farmers opt-out?).
 You should also be more concrete about how the information that was offered
 relates to the behaviors that were measured (i.e.
 which inputs you did or did not recommend?) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The information provided was rather specific.
 For instance, in the video we show in detail how land should be prepared
 using organic fertilizer, how to plant in rows with optimal spacing, when
 to plant and when to weed.
 A lot of attention is devoted to identifying striga early on and farmers
 are encouraged to remove it early to avoid the weed from affecting the
 maize.
 In terms of inputs, we promote the use of improved seed.
 We recommend using hybrids, and if that is too expensive, at least go for
 open pollinated varieties.
 We even go as far as recommending two particular types of each (Longe 10H
 and Bazooka for hybrids, Longe 5 and Longe 4 for OPVs).
 For inorganic fertilizers, we recommend basal application of DAP or NPK
 at planting and top dressing of Urea during the growing stage.
 For all inputs, optimal quantities and proper application methods are shown.
 The video also recommends a commercial approach to farmers: We point out
 how investing now can make a farmer grow over time and that it is often
 better to start small using all the inputs and practices than only using
 eg good seed on the entire plot, but no fertilizer.
 The info provided through the IVR is as similar as possible .
 For instance, also here the same seeds and fertilizer were named, and the
 same quantities recommended and application methods explained.
 In general, there was a very close correspondence between what we recommend
 and the outcomes that were used to assess the impact of the intervention.

Controversial may be the wrong wording.
 It is just a new way of spacing that deviates from what farmers have been
 doing for centuries and what most extension workers are teaching (and also
 what is indicated on the bags of seed).
 So it may be controversial from the point of view of the farmer.
 It is not controversial in that it may not be correct.
 It is a better way of spacing (resulting in higher yields) and it is the
 official recommendation for all future agricultural extension information
 dissemination in Uganda.

 In the adoption tables, you code effects on opposite directions as ‘correct’
 when you construct your indexes.
 This seems arbitrary.
 For instance, you claim that “one can argue that DAP/NPK is higher than
 optimal and urea is lower than optimal” and therefore interpret the positive/ne
gative direction of the effects as following the advice.
 You do a similar thing for the negative effect on organic fertilizers for
 the IVR arm.
 You should be more transparent on what was the recommendation and what
 was the hypothesized direction of the effects ex-ante.

 Since the randomization was carried out at the household level and there

 A discussion on how close the answers between household members are would

As mentioned in footnote 1 in the manuscript, this study was part of a larger
 study that also mixed in other factors to study gender related issues in
 agricultural extension.
 One of these research topics was related to exactly these kind of frictions
 in diffusion of information within the household.
 In particular, screening of the video itself was also randomize into three
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

treatment arms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: In 1/3 of households that were allocated to the video treatment, the man
 alone was shown the video.
 In another 1/3 rd, the video was shown to the woman alone and in the final
 1/3rd, the video was shown to the couple (man+woman) together.
 In a different paper, we plan to use this part of the field experiment
 to learn about information flows within the household.
 While the research hypotheses related to these intra-household information
 transfer inefficiencies were conceptualized and implemented at the individual
 level, the research hypotheses related to the delivery mode studied in
 this paper (video, video+IVR,video+IVR+SMS) was conceptualized and implemented
 at the household level (and dummies for who was shown the video was included
 in all regressions).
 For more information about the design of the entire project and how the
 different factors were integrated into a 3 by 3 full factorial design,
 we refer to the pre-analysis plan.

With respect to attrition, during endline, we interviewed men and women

 While general attrition was unavoidable, we tried to make sure this attrition

 attrition and also calculates manski bounds.

Answers of both spouses were used to construct household level outcomes.
 For continuous variables, generally, a simple average was taken between
 the two members.
 For binary outcomes, such as whether the household gained knowledge on
 a particular topic, we assumed the household learned if at least one member
 indicated the correct answer.
 For adoption of a particular practice of input, we indicate the household
 adopts if at least one household adopts on at least one plot.
 While it would indeed be interesting to look at differences in reporting
 between spouses, this is more related to the research hypotheses that were
 conceptualize at the individual level and will be discussed there; We feel
 it goes beyond the scope of the current paper.

 A potential issue with projects that use self-reported data following an

 I would like to know how much of a problem this might be in this context.

 between answers? Additionally, can you report how robust are the yield

 social desirability or experimenter demand effects have been mentioned

 that our analysis is driven by social desirability bias.

A key concern with this study is the use of self-reported survey data on
 key outcomes, as opposed to outcomes that are measured by a third party
 in an objective way.
 Study participants may report what they feel is desired in that context
 (social desirability bias).
 In an RCT, social desirability bias becomes a real concern if it is correlated
 to the treatment, which is sometimes referred to as experimenter demand
 effects

 less problematic than initially thought 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

before "eg."
key "de2018measuring,mummolo2019demand"

\end_inset

, we provide some discussion on why we feel experimenter demand effects
 are unlikely to drive our results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
First, during the design of the endline questionnaire, we tried to minimize
 potential experimenter demand effects by careful formulation of the questions.
 Experimenter demand effects are more likely to be a concern for simple
 yes/no questions than for more open ended questions.
 For instance, in our endline survey, we did not ask if farmers used 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plant spacing of 75cm x 30cm with a reduced seed rate of 1 seed per hill
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as recommended.
 Rather, we asked farmers to describe the planting process, and the enumerator
 was then asked to select the appropriate response from a list of options
 that was not revealed to the farmer.
 For input adoption, we started from broad questions (eg.
 whether fertilizer was used on a particular plot) and then asked farmers
 to go further into detail (eg.
 asking about fertilizer type, timing of application, quantities and price)
 allowing enumerators to detect inconsistencies that may signal experimenter
 demand effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
Second, in our endline survey, not all outcomes are equally likely to be
 affected by experimenter demand effects.
 For instance, experimenter demand effects are probably less likely to be
 an issue for the multiple choice questions used to measure knowledge than
 for questions about implementation of recommended practices or the use
 of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer or improved seed.
 It is reassuring that there is consistency between effects found on questions
 that are more or less prone to experimenter demand effect.
 In other words, if we would have found that our interventions did not result
 in a change in knowledge related to optimal plant spacing, yet farmers
 report that they did use optimal plant spacing on their plots, we would
 be more worried that the latter effect was driven by experimenter demand
 effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
Third, as we will report in the next section, fertilizer adoption, an outcome
 prone to experimenter demand effects, seems to increase particularly for
 treated farmers that live close to an agro-input dealer.
 This finding reduces the possibility that results are driven by misreporting
 related to experimenter demand effects, as this would mean that households
 that have better access to improved inputs strategically decide to report
 their answers differently than households that have less access to inputs.

In this section, we explore potential heterogeneity in the treatment effects.
 We do this by running the regression model 1 again, but only for a particular
 group of farmers as determined by their baseline characteristics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
First, we test if treatment effects differ with the education levels of
 farmers.
 We mentioned in the introduction that video may be particularly effective
 in transferring information to lowly educated and illiterate farmer.
 Therefore, we reran model 1, but only for farmers that did not finish primary
 schooling (which is about 65 percent of farmers in our sample).
 In Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:cate_know"

\end_inset

, which corresponds to Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowh0HH"

\end_inset

 for the full sample, we see that the increase in knowledge about optimal
 spacing and seed rate, and to a lesser extent about the benefits of combining
 inputs, is indeed higher among lower educated farmers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
Farmers are unlikely to adopt a particular modern input if they lack information
 about its existence, use and benefits.
 However, once farmers have access to information, they also need to be
 able to obtain the inputs at a reasonable cost.
 We therefore also look at how treatment effects vary with distance to an
 agro-input dealer.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:cate_tech"

\end_inset

 shows regressions similar to those reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

, but now only for the subset of farmers that live relatively close to an
 agro-input dealer (within a 5 km radius, corresponding to about two thirds
 of all farmers in our sample).
 We find that the video treatment effect for the likelihood that farmers
 report using urea is now 2.1 percentage points higher.
 For organic fertilizer, the coefficient estimate is similar to the one
 obtained for the full sample.
 Also for hybrid seed, we find that the effect of the IVR encouragement
 is 1.4 percentage points higher among farmers that live relatively close
 to an agro-input dealer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
In sub-section 5.1, we already looked at the narrower effect of IVR for farmers
 that actually called in.
 However, also for the additional SMS treatment, one would probably only
 expect to see an effect for households that have a mobile phone and were
 able to receive the SMS.
 Averaging outcomes over all household may dilute the treatment effect,
 making it more difficult to detect a significant difference between the
 treatment group and control group.
 We thus estimated equation 1 again, but only for households that report
 that they own a mobile phone.
 However, restricting the sample in this way did not alter the findings
 reported in the previous section.

Minor comments:

 At some points in the paper, the way you phrase the interventions creates
 the illusion that you are running a horse-race between IVR, SMS and videos.
 For instance, your title and abstract mention “ICT to provide agricultural
 advice”.
 However, the IVR arm only gave farmers access to information and the SMS
 was (at least conceptually) meant to serve as reminders not as information
 provision.
 At another point you say “IVR did not have a strong influence on the modern
 use of inputs or management practices”.
 This should read “additional advice through IVR.”

 I disagree with your statement that “SMS cannot be used to provide new

 Some of the papers you cite use SMS to provide agricultural information.
 Several companies/NGOs around the world also use SMS to provide agricultural
 advice.
 You probably might want to qualify this claim a bit more.

In the conclusion, we now also make more careful claims about what IVR and

 We also note that the null results need to be interpreted with caution

 I think it is very interesting that you see a reduction of land cultivated.
 This seems to be in line with the intervention that told farmers to intensively

We do not think our results are driven by outliers.
 As is specified in our pre-analysis plan, we conduct analysis on 5 percent
 trimmed values of continuous variables.
 The pre-analysis plan also states that trimming is always done on the end
 result just before the analysis.
 For instance for area, we first take the logarithm and then trim.
 For yield, we first divide production by area, then take the logarithm
 and then trim.
 Trimming at 10 percent leads to the same results.

 Since farmers were visited twice for the videos, that could have already

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Farmers were shown the video twice: once before the agricultural season
 and once early in that same season.
 The intention here was to provide the participating farmers with all the
 basic information required.
 The SMS messages was more targeted, in that it reminded farmers of particular
 topics discussed in the video at specific points in time, with the inention
 of providing timely reminders would make the information more salient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
One can speculate about the potential reasons why the reminders did not
 work in our case.
 The fact that farmers were already reminded once and reminders have decreasing
 marginal effects may be one potential reason.
 Another reason may be that it is always difficult to get the exact timing
 right: variation in planting time, rainfall, plant growth, crop duration,
 and other factors–even with the same agro-ecological zone–imply that even
 the most well-timed SMS reminders might miss the precise mark.
 Unavoidably, we encountered situations where farmers had planted much earlier
 than in other areas due to spatial heterogeneity in the onset of the rains.
 As a result, some farmers received the SMS message on fertilizer application
 too early and others too late.
 Maybe the content of the reminders could have been adapted accordingly
 (though not without considerable cost and logistical complexity), or maybe
 a more imperative tone such as

While there is some minor imbalance, this seems to be within what one would

 As such, imbalance can not be responsible for our findings on the impact
 of the video intervention (otherwise, this would indeed be one of our greatest
 concerns).

We take your point.
 We note that the video intervention does increase the outcome by about

 At the same time, and in hindsight, we also suspect that the insignificant
 result may be due to the inherent difficulty in formulating this kind of
 subjective question, even though such questions are commonly used to assess
 not only production outcomes, but also hunger and food security, safety
 and security, and many other outcomes.
 In this instance, while our (preferred) measure of maize yield is obtained
 indirectly by dividing production on the plot by the size of the plot,
 here the farmer is asked to directly assess his or her maize yields on
 the plot.
 We fear many farmers may find it difficult to convert production on the
 plot to yields, and therefore may be implicitly comparing production on
 the plot to what it normally would be.
 If farmers intensify production on only part of the plot and leave the
 rest fallow, they may indicate that maize production on the plot was similar
 to what they normally get from that plot.

Farmers may have confused yields with production.
 Consistent with our recommendation to start small and combine technologies
 and the results that yield effects are due to producing the same amounts
 on smaller plots, farmers may indicate that on the plot the same amount
 of maize was produced when part was left fallow or planted with another
 crop.

Note: In the first column, means (and standard deviations) in the control
 group are presented for each variable.
 Column 2 reports differences between placebo and video treatment (and standard
 error) with its corresponding p-value in column 3; column 4 reports differences
 between video only and video+ivr (and standard error) with its corresponding
 p-value in column 5; column 6 reports differences between video+ivr and
 video+ivr+SMS (and standard error) with its corresponding p-value in column
 7; sample size is reported in column 8.
 Reported p-values are based on randomization inference (10,000 permutations);
 ***, ** and * denote that the difference is signficant at the 1, 5 and
 10 percent level, respectively, after correcting for multiple hypothesis
 testing using a family-wise sharp null (10,000 permutations).
 All specifications control for the other orthogonal factors in the factorial
 design.

Note: All entries are t-tests, except for the last column and the last row,
 where F-tests are reported for the joint tests.
 Corresponding p-values in brackets below.
 Tests are derived from a linear probability models with a binary indicator
 of attrition as the dependent variable.
 The first row tests differential attrition rates for each treatment seperately:
 the video intervention (column 1), the incremental IVR encouragement (column
 2) and the additional SMS treatment (column 3).
 The last column perfoms a joint test of differential attrition on the 3
 treatments.
 Subsequent rows test differential attrition rates for interactions between
 each baseline variable indicated to the left and each treatment indicator
 seperately (columns 1, 2 and 3) and jointly (column 4).
 Last row tests differential attrition rates for intractions between all
 baseline variables jointly and each treatment indicator seperately (columns
 1, 2 and 3) and all treatments jointly (column 4).

Note: Column 1 reports differences between placebo and video treatment (and
 standard error between brackets below) for the outcome indicated to the
 left after all missing values due to attrition have been replaced by the
 minimum value of the outcome indicated to the left; Column 2reports differences
 between placebo and video treatment (and standard error) for the outcome
 after all missing values due to attrition have been replaced by the maximum
 value of the outcome; columns 3 and 4 report corresponding estimates (and
 standard error below) for differences between video only and video+ivr;
 columns 5 and 6 report corresponding estimates (and standard error below)
 for differences between video+ivr and video+ivr+SMS.
 All specifications control for the other orthogonal factors in the factorial
 design.
 For indices, missings were replaced in the variables that constitute the
 components of the index before the index was computed, so the bounds do
 not necessarily include the estimated coefficient.
