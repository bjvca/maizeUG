\begin_layout Title
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) to provide agricultural
 advice to smallholder farmers: Experimental evidence from Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Agricultural advisory services generally rely on interpersonal knowledge
 transfer in which agricultural extension agents visit farmers individually
 or in groups to provide information and advice.
 This approach is not always effective and has often proved hard to bring
 to scale, particularly in highly dispersed smallholder farming systems.
 Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been advanced as
 a promising way to overcome many of the problems associated with conventional
 agricultural extension.
 We evaluate the effectiveness of an ICT-mediated approach to deliver agricultur
al information in a field experiment conducted among small-scale maize farmers
 in eastern Uganda.
 Our approach consists of three complementary technologies: First, we investigat
e the effectiveness of audiovisual messages as a means of delivering information
 to farmers.
 Second, we quantify the additional impact of augmenting video with interactive
 voice response (IVR) technology.
 Third, we estimate the incremental effect of time-sensitive short message
 services (SMS) messages that remind farmers about key agronomic practices.
 We find that ICT-mediated audiovisual content is effective in delivering
 information, with households that were shown short videos on how to become
 a better maize farmer performing significantly better on a knowledge test,
 more likely to apply recommended practices, and using inputs more efficiently
 than households that did not see this video.
 These same households also reported maize yields about 10 percent higher
 than those that did not see the video.
 Very few of the farmers that were invited to use the IVR systems appeared
 to make use of it, potentially explaining the absence of an incremental
 effect.
 We also find few additional effects from the SMS reminder.

\begin_layout Standard
This article investigates the effectiveness of an ICT-mediated extension
 approach designed to provide information about improved maize cultivation
 practices to smallholder farmers in Uganda.
 We acknowledge that ICTs are not homogeneous and that farmers also have
 differing information needs.
 At the same time, we realize that many ICT applications have low fixed
 and near zero variable costs.
 The primary focus of this study is to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive
 ICT-mediated agricultural extension approach consisting of three complementary
 information technologies.
 First, we look at the effectiveness of short audiovisual messages that
 provide detailed information on how to improve maize cultivation, that
 were shown to farmers on tablet computers.
 The strength of video is that it can combine audio and visual information
 in an attractive way that is recognizable to the potentially illiterate
 farmer.
 Second, we estimate the additional effect of an IVR service that farmers
 are encouraged to call into if the need arises.
 In an IVR system, a farmer calls a phone number and navigates through a
 menu to select a topic.
 The farmer then gets to listen to a pre-recorded message with information
 on the selected topic.
 Third, we evaluate the impact of augmenting this with SMS messages that
 remind farmers at particular points during the maize growing season about
 key farming practices, and that they can call the IVR system at any time.
 The outcomes used to assess the effectiveness of this approach include
 increases in knowledge about improved maize cultivation, changes in the
 use of improved inputs and recommended agronomic practices, and production.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We draw on a field experiment involving approximately 4,000 farm households
 sampled from the population of households cultivating maize across five
 districts of eastern Uganda.
 We find that providing information to farmers through short videos significantl
y increased their knowledge about modern agronomic inputs and recommended
 agronomic practices.
 In addition, farmers who were shown the video were also more likely to
 adopt a range of inputs and practices that were promoted in the videos.
 We also find clear effects on production, with maize yields 10 percent
 higher than in control households.
 We find that the IVR generated no additional impact on knowledge, nor did
 it have a strong influence on the use of modern inputs or management practices
 in farming.
 We only find a positive effect of IVR on the uptake of hybrid seed.
 However, uptake of the IVR technology was very low, with only about There
 were no additional effects of the SMS messages.

 modern inputs and improved crop management practices among smallholder
 farmersâ€”a topic that has received considerable attention in recent years

Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conducted the field experiment among smallholder maize farmers in Uganda.
 Maize is widely consumed throughout much of Uganda, yet its value-to-weight
 ratio is sufficiently high to also make it an important traded commodity.
 Therefore, efforts to increase maize productivity at the farm-household
 level are an important dimension of Uganda's strategy to increase food
 security and reduce poverty through both consumption and income channels.
 Yet, maize yields in Uganda are low when compared to neighboring countries
 and global averages: While research station trials conducted in Uganda
 report potential yields of about 1.6 metric tons per acre (using only improved
 varieties without fertilizer application), data from the Uganda National
 Household Survey (UNHS) 2005/06 indicate that average maize yields are
 much lower at about 618 kg per acre for the main growing season

.
 At the same time, the use of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer
 and adoption of modern management practices such as row planting is very
 low in Uganda.

\begin_layout Standard
In eastern Uganda, there are two maize cropping seasons.
 For our study, we concentrated on the second maize-growing season of the
 year 2017, which ran from approximately August 2017 to January 2018 and
 is characterized by a shorter period of rainfall than the first maize-growing
 season.
 During this second season, the complete cycle from planting to harvest
 requires 3 to 3.5 months, and farmers tend to cultivate early-maturing but
 lower-yielding maize varieties as a result.
 Fields are prepared in August, planted in September, an harvested beginning
 in mid to late December and, at higher elevations, through mid January.

 The experiment has four treatment arms, and the IVR and SMS treatments
 are incremental in design.
 The experimental units are the households, who were randomly assigned to
 one of these your arms.
 A total of 3,703 households were shown a video, while 256 households (our
 control group) were shown a placebo video.
 From those 3,703 households that were shown a video, 2,414 also received
 an IVR starter kit: a flyer containing a toll-free phone number and instruction
s on how to use it.
 From those 2,414 households that were shown a video and received the IVR
 encouragement, 1,113 households were also allocated to the SMS treatment

Ex ante, we expected the largest effect size for the video intervention,
 and power calculations indicated that we only needed about 250 observations
 in each group to detect this.
 Much smaller effects were expected from adding the other two technologies,
 so a larger sample was needed to retain statistical power.
 Power calculations were bases on an elaborate set of comparisons using
 different outcomes to power the complete 
\begin_inset Formula $3^{3}$
\end_inset

 factorial design.
 We used simulation techniques that allowed us to to sample from actual
 data on outcome variables instead of from a theoretical distribution with
 an assumed mean and standard deviation.
 Apart from the sample size in the control group, sample size in other treatment
 arms are the result of binding constraints for minimal sample size needed
 to test differences in two other factors of the design.
 Detailed information on the power calculations can be found in the pre-analysis.

\begin_layout Standard
We sampled from five districts in eastern Uganda known for their maize productio
n: Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo, and Namutumba.
 From this, we removed from our sample town councils and also two sub-counties
 that consisted of islands in lake Victoria.
 We used two-stage cluster sampling to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, from the five districts, we first selected 50 parishes randomly
 with the probability of selection in proportion to the number of villages
 within each parish.
 Within each village in the selected parishes, we then listed all households,
 from which we randomly selected 10 households to participate in the study.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In each village, one of the 10 households was randomly allocated to the
 control group (which got to see a placebo video).
 The remaining 9 households were all shown a video.
 As mentioned in footnote 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fn:full_study"

\end_inset

, this research was part of a larger research project that also used the
 video intervention to explore issues related to gender in agricultural
 extension.
 Because of this, we also experimentally varied who provided the information
 in the video (a man alone, a woman alone, or a couple (man+woman)) as well
 as to whom the video was shown within the household (a man alone, a woman
 alone, or a couple (man+woman)).
 In the context of a factorial design with two factors and each 3 levels,
 this corresponded to 9 treatment combinations.
 We thus used the village as blocs, and randomly assigned the nine potential
 treatment combinations to the remaining 9 households in each village.
 We then added the IVR treatment randomly to 2/3 of the households in each
 treatment cell.
 For example, from the 385 households where the man within the household
 would be shown a video where a man provides all the information, 257 randomly
 selected households were also provided with the encouragement to use the
 IVR.
 Among those that were allocated the IVR in each treatment cell, we then
 randomly allocated half of the households to the SMS treatment.
 For instance, from the 257 households where the man would be shown a video
 featuring a man and who also were allocated to receive the IVR treatment,
 128 where randomly allocated to also receive the SMS reminders.
 As such, the treatment cells created by the interaction of the 2 other
 factors were used as blocs in the randomization of IVR and SMS treatments.
 The exact same sampling procedure was used in the permutation algorithm
 that was used to judge significance through randomization inference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To evaluate the effectiveness of these different ICT channels, we start
 by comparing average household-level outcomes among households that were
 shown a video to average outcomes of households from the control group.
 This gives us the average treatment effect for the video intervention.
 To obtain the additional effect of the IVR treatment, we compare average
 outcomes of households that were shown a video and received the IVR interventio
n to households that were shown only a video.
 Finally, the additional effect of the SMS campaign is estimated by comparing
 outcomes of household that were shown a video, received IVR information
 and also received the eight SMS reminders to outcomes of households that
 are shown a video and received the information about the IVR system, but
 did not get the SMS reminders.
 In practice, this is done using a simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regressio
n of the form:

While we did not conduct a dedicated baseline survey, we did collect some
 information prior to the experiment's roll-out to investigate balance.
 The choice of variables was based on those variables that other researchers
 in similar studies used in their orthogonality tests.
 In particular, we looked at balance tables in studies that investigate
 the adoption of yield-improving technologies and practices using randomized
 controlled trials (RCTs), including

 We collected household characteristics such as household size, age, and,
 education level of household head.
 We then asked more specific questions related to maize farming, such as
 acreage and quantities produced in the last season.
 Furthermore, we asked if the household received agricultural extension
 services, whether it used improved maize varieties, and whether it applied
 fertilizer to maize.
 We also collected data on housing conditions (number of bedrooms) and distance
 to the nearest agro-input shop.
 As mobile phone ownership is relevant to the IVR and SMS interventions,
 we also report balance on household access to and ownership of a mobile
 phone.

In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance"

\end_inset

, we provide descriptive statistics and balance tests for the comparisons
 between the three information delivery packages.
 Averages for the control group are reported in the first column.
 We observe that few households that were included in our study had access
 to agricultural extension in the previous year (about 11 percent).
 We also observe that only about 17 percent of households reported to have
 used any fertilizer in the previous season, and only about 34 percent reported
 to have used improved seed bought from a shop or agro-input dealer during
 the last cropping season.
 This suggests ample scope to increase intensification investments through
 extension.
 We also find that farmers produced on average only 268 kg of maize per
 acre in the first cropping season of 2017.
 This is substantially lower than the average yield of 618 kg per acre we
 find in data from the 2005/06 Uganda National Household Survey.
 The low yields reflect the devastating impact of the fall armyworm outbreak
 and adverse weather conditions that plagued East Africa in 2017

Balance is tested by judging the significance of coefficient estimates in
 a regression (equation

 video (
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

 in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 For example, we see that yields prior to the intervention were about 17
 kg per acre higher in the group that was shown the intervention video than
 in the group that was shown the placebo video.
 However, this difference is not significantly different from zero.
 In fact, for the placebo video versus intervention video comparison, none
 of the differences in baseline characteristics is significant at the 10
 percent significance level, and the F-statistic can not be rejected.
 In the third column, differences in baseline characteristics between households
 that received the intervention video and households that received the IVR
 starter kit on top of the video are shown (denoted

 Here, we see that, at baseline, households in the latter group were significant
ly larger than households that only saw the video.
 They also had significantly more bedrooms and the household head was slightly
 older.
 However, we can again not reject the null that jointly, baseline characteristic
s were unrelated to the treatment group for this comparison.
 For the final comparison (comparing farmers that received video and IVR
 to those that additionally received SMS messages; reported in column four

 figure is only significant at the 10 percent level and the joint test does
 not reject overall balance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that about 84 percent of households had access to a mobile phone
 prior to the intervention.
 This is encouraging, as the usefulness of IVR depends on access to a mobile
 phone.
 Further, we find that there was no difference in this percentage between
 the various treatment groups.
 The incidence of mobile phone ownership was also high, with about three
 quarters of households reporting they own a mobile phone.
 Again, this is important as the success of the SMS intervention depends
 on being able to receive the messages.

\begin_layout Section*
ICT interventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The comprehensive ICT-mediated extension approach consisted of three ICT
 interventions: a short video, an encouragement to use an IVR system, and
 series of 8 SMS messages.
 The videos were shown on 10-inch Android tablet computers and screened
 by a trained field enumerator during a one-to-one meeting with either an
 individual farmer or the male and female co-head
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In particular, the person or persons within the household to whom the video
 was shown was dictated by one of the other factors in the factorial design,
 and were either the man co-head within the household alone, the woman co-head
 within the household alone, or the man and woman co-heads as a couple together.
 As this factor was orthogonal to the factor corresponding to the information
 technologies in the factorial design, it does not matter who within the
 household the video is shown to, and the treatment effect corresponds to
 the average impact at the household level.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The control group received a placebo treatment, which was a music video
 of traditional dancing that contained no information related to farming
 or maize 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1093/wber/lhv014"

\end_inset

.
 Videos (treatment or placebo) were screened twice to the households in
 the sample, once before the time for planting maize (July 2017) and once
 around planting time (August 2017).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information contained in the treatment groups' video is expected to
 positively influence maize yields by encouraging the adoption of several
 improved technologies and practices.
 The topics included in the video script were obtained from qualitative
 interviews with key informants that were conducted in May 2017.
 The key informants included maize farmers, traders, maize breeders, extension
 workers, district agricultural officers, and other government staff and
 experts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A significant portion of the videos focuses on providing technical information
 on seed choice, soil nutrient management (including the promotion of both
 organic and inorganic fertilizer application), weeding (with particular
 attention on fighting striga), timely planting, and plant spacing, which
 were ranked among by the experts as the top challenges farmers face.
 We made sure to include information that is likely to be unknown to the
 farmer, as information is likely to be most valuable when individuals learn
 about a new technology or institutional innovation.
 However, other studies also provide evidence of behavioral change occurring
 through the compounding or re-emphasis of common knowledge that, through
 repetition, becomes more salient to the individual 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "duflo2014diffusion"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the videos also contain information that farmers are assumed
 to know but do not seem to act upon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all constraints to maize productivity improvement are information deficienci
es directly related to the use of inputs, technologies, and crop management
 practices.
 Often, missing information problems manifest indirectly, as uncertainty
 about the distribution of the farm-household's profit function.
 This includes uncertainty about the correlations between expected and actual
 returns, the inter-temporality of income streams, estimates of fixed and
 variable costs, hidden transactions costs, probabilities of adverse events,
 and a range of other variables that farmers may simply be unable to conceptuali
ze or measure.
 Thus, a significant portion of the videos also focuses on evaluating the
 costs and benefits of the different technologies and practices being promoted.
 In addition, the videos encourage long-term thinking, advising farmers
 to (a) start small and grow their farm enterprise over time, and (b) combine
 technologies and practices together rather than investing all of their
 money and effort into one single input, practice, or technology.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also pay attention to how the information is packaged.
 For instance, prior studies have found that farmers find communicators
 who face agricultural conditions and constraints most comparable to their
 own to be the more persuasive than other communicators

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 A growing strand of the literature investigates how non-cognitive farmer
 characteristics such as aspirations, locus of control and self-esteem can
 lead to behavioral change such as technology adoption

 Therefore, in our video, the message is conveyed by individuals who are
 readily recognized as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 and who provide information that is framed as a success story.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two other treatments were incrementally added to the video treatment.
 For these two treatments, the IVR system and the SMS reminders, we collaborated
 with Viamo, a social enterprise that aims to connect individuals and organizati
ons using digital technology to make better decisions.
 We set up an IVR system that provided the same information as was recommended
 in the video.
 Farm households that were allocated the IVR treatment were encouraged to
 call a toll-free number which explained the IVR system in their own language.
 The caller is then invited to select the number corresponding to the topic
 on which he or she wants more information (e.g., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Press 1 for seed selection, 2 for spacing and seed rate, 3 for soil nutrient
 management, 4 for advice on weeding
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Depending on what number was selected, the IVR then played an audio message
 of a conversation between two farmers where one farmer is explaining the
 recommended practice to the other farmer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the SMS campaign, we recorded telephone numbers for mobile phones owned
 by the household head at the time of the experiment's roll-out.
 Households that were allocated to the SMS treatment were sent eight SMS
 messages over the course of the two months following the first screening
 of the video.
 The messages all followed a similar structure: farmers were first reminded
 about an important technology or practice that was relevant at the particular
 time that the message was sent, followed by a reminder about the existence
 of the IVR service.
 The reminders were related to technologies and practices that were also
 promoted in the video and IVR.
 For example, the first message, that was sent out around planting time,
 read 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 seed.

 About one month into the growing season, the following message was sent:

\begin_layout Section*
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now turn to the results.
 We first estimate intent-to-treat effects for the (incremental) impact
 of the three information technologies on a range of outcomes related to
 knowledge, adoption of recommended practices and use of modern inputs,
 and production.
 However, while all households that were allocated to the video treatment
 did view it, compliance was not perfect for IVR and SMS treatments.
 Judged by the call log of the IVR system, we find that only a small number
 of households that were encouraged to use the IVR system also actually
 called in (8.9 percent or 214 households).
 For the SMS reminders, of the 1,113 households that were supposed to receive
 the reminders, only 860 (77.3 percent) did.
 We therefore also generated Local Average Treatment Effects (LATE) estimates,
 where the IVR encouragement was used as an instrument for having called
 into the IVR system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Similarly, we estimated LATEs where allocation to the SMS treatment is
 used as an instrument for having received the SMS message.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Impact on knowledge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first estimate the incremental impact of the three different ICT channels
 on knowledge outcomes.
 Knowledge outcomes were measured with a short quiz 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "feder2004acquisition,feder2004sending,masset2015does"

\end_inset

 consisting of four multiple-choice questions that were asked during the
 endline survey to each of the two spouses in the farm household separately.
 For each question, three possible answers were read out to the respondent,
 who was then asked to indicate which answer he or she thought was correct.
 The respondent was also allowed to indicate if he or she did not know the
 correct answer.
 The household was considered knowledgeable on a particular topic if at
 least one of the spouses could indicate the correct answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first question was related to planting.
 In our video, we recommended a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with one seed per
 hill, and this was the correct option.
 Other possible answers included a spacing of 75cm x 60cm with two seeds
 per hill, which is standard for many farmers and recommended by many agricultur
al extension agents, and an intermediate alternative of 75cm x 30cm with
 two seeds per hill.
 Because our video recommended a technique that deviates from what is assumed
 to be standard spacing, we assumed that the recommended practice is new
 to most of the farmers.
 This question thus tests a traditional theory of change, where extension
 leads to improvements of knowledge, which increases adoption of improved
 practices and subsequently boosts yields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second question is less related to technical knowledge, but more to
 viewing farming as a business.
 In the video, we paid ample attention to promoting an approach where farmers
 start small and grow over time by reinvesting, and we emphasized the benefits
 of combining inputs rather than investing only in e.g., improved seed.
 We wanted to see if farmers internalize this advice and ask what a successful
 farmer would do if he or she only has 40,000 shillings.
 The correct answer was to use this amount to purchase improved seed and
 fertilizer and start intensified farming on a small area.
 Alternative options were to: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

use all the money to buy hybrid seeds, because without good seeds, yields
 will be low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

use all the money to buy fertilizer, because with poor soils, yields will
 be low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This question suggests impact works more through aspirational channels,
 testing if farmers understood the broader message given in the video that
 successful farmers generally see maize farming more as a business which
 requires foresight and risk taking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the third question, we asked if farmers knew when weeding is most important.
 The video showed that weeding is most important during the first four weeks
 after planting, as maize is a poor competitor for light and nutrients.
 We assumed that most farmers would know the correct answer to this question
 given that weeding is part of well-established management practices in
 the study area.
 Alternative answers were: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when the maize is knee high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when the maize is at tasseling stage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The relevant theory of change here is that ICT interventions may be used
 to make a known technology more salient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we asked if farmers knew when spraying against fall armyworm is
 most effective.
 No information was given about fighting fall armyworm in the intervention,
 so unless one of our interventions encouraged farmers to search for additional
 information, we do not expect an impact.
 For this question, the correct option was: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

During the evening, as fall armyworm eats during night,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while the other options were: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Early in the morning when it is still cool
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

At noon because sunlight increases chemical performance.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To guard against over-rejection of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference
, outcomes of the knowledge questions were combined into an index, constructed
 as the weighted mean of the individual standardized outcomes, using as
 weights the inverse of the co-variance matrix of the transformed outcomes
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "anderson2008multiple"

\end_inset

.
 However, we also see value in examining the impact on the questions individuall
y, as they attempt to measure different aspects of the information intervention.
 To control the family-wise error rate (FWER) when examining results for
 each question individually, we use re-randomization to construct the joint
 null distribution for the family of outcomes we are testing.
 From this family-wise sharp null, we can obtain the corresponding FWER-consiste
nt significance thresholds by determining which cuttoffs yield e.g., 10 percent-,
 5 percent-, and 1 percent significant hypothesis tests across all tests
 and simulations.

Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:knowh0HH"

\end_inset

 shows results for the three incremental levels of ICT-mediated information
 delivery using different information technologies.
 The first column reports mean scores in the control group (with standard
 deviations reported below in parentheses).
 For the four individual questions, this is simply the proportion of households
 in the control group that answered correctly on the particular question.
 For instance, we find that in 16 percent of the households in the control
 group, at least one of the spouses indicated the correct option among the
 response alternatives to the question on optimal maize seed spacing.
 This relatively low rate of correct responses is due to the fact that this
 is a fairly new and potentially controversial recommendation.
 We find that in about 91 percent of control households, at least one spouse
 knew inputs were best combined and in more than 95 percent of households
 it was known that weeding is most important during the first 4 weeks.
 In about one third of the households, at least one spouse knew how to fight
 fall armyworm.
 For the knowledge index, the mean is harder to interpret, as it is the
 result of a weighted mean after standardization of the individual components
 of the index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second column, we report the impact of having been shown the video
 (with standard errors of the estimated coefficient reported below in parenthese
s).
 We find that having been shown the video increases the likelihood that
 at least one individual knows the recommended spacing by 13 percentage
 points and this difference is significantly different from zero at the
 1 percent FWER-adjusted significance level (randomization inference-based
 p-value are shown in the third column; asterisks denote significance as
 compared to FWER-adjusted thresholds).
 We also find that the video increased the likelihood that at least one
 spouse indicates that inputs are best combined for optimal results by 4.5
 percentage points.
 This difference is statistically significant at the 5 percent FWER-adjusted
 significance level.
 For the question on weeding, the intervention does not seem to have had
 a significant effect.
 However, this result should be interpreted with care due limited variation
 in the outcome.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In fact, our pre-analysis plan specifies that we would drop from the analysis
 variables where 95 percent of outcomes are the same value.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Finally, on the fall armyworm question, we find that households that were
 shown the video are no more likely than control households to know when
 one should spray to control the pest.
 This suggests that the videos did not encourage farmers to actively search
 information on important challenges that were not explicitly covered in
 the video.
 Overall, and as confirmed by the knowledge index, we conclude that the
 agricultural extension videos increased knowledge at the household level,
 and that this increase seems especially poignant for novel information
 provided in the videos.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fourth column (+IVR) shows the incremental effect of IVR (with standard
 errors of the estimated coefficient reported below in parentheses, and
 corresponding randomization inference-based p-value in the fifth column).
 We see that being provided with an IVR encouragement does not additionally
 affect knowledge about the new recommended spacing.
 There is some indication that the IVR treatment reduces the likelihood
 that at least one spouse responded correctly on the question about how
 inputs should be combined, but the reduction is not significantly different
 from zero after taking multiple inference into account.
 Similarly, there is no additional effect on knowledge related to the optimal
 time for weeding and also no additional effect on knowledge about the best
 way to fight fall armyworm.
 The fact that there is no supplementary effect of the IVR encouragement
 on knowledge is confirmed by the non-significant difference in the knowledge
 index.
 The sixth column (+SMS) reports the additional effect of the SMS reminders
 on the various questions and the index (with randomization inference-based
 p-value reported in the seventh column).
 Similar to the impact of IVR, we do not find an additional effect of the
 SMS campaign on any of the questions.
 We also do not find an effect of the SMS campaign as judged by the knowledge
 index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*

\series bold
Adoption effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We continue our analysis by examining the effect of our incremental treatments
 on household-level adoption of recommended farming practices.
 During the endline survey, we collected detailed information on practices
 employed on the household's maize plots.
 Results of mean adoption rates in the control group for different practices
 are reported in the first column of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_h1_ag"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, in the video, we recommend to start planting maize immediately
 after the start of the rains.
 We find that 37 percent of households in the control group reported that
 they started planting within one day after the start of the rains on at
 least on plotâ€”a relatively high rate of adoption for this practice that
 indicates the extent to which it is likely known among farmers.
 We also find that only 2.6 percent of households in the control group used
 the recommended way of plant spacing of 75cm x 30cm with a reduced seed
 rate of 1 seed per hill.
 This low rate in the control group is not surprising given that this was
 a new and somewhat controversial recommendation.
 Almost 69 percent of control households report removing striga before it
 flowered to reduce damage early on and prevent the weed from spreading.
 Finally, we find that about 43 percent of control households reported first
 weeding after 18-20 days as recommended in the video.

The second column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 again reports the difference in the adoption of practices between households
 that were shown the intervention video and households that were give the
 placebo treatment (with standard error of the estimate in parenthesis below
 and corresponding randomization inference-based p-values in column 3).
 We find that for the first recommended practice, early planting, there
 is no impact from the video treatment.
 However, the likelihood that households adopt the recommended 75cm x 30cm
 spacing with a reduced seeding rate increases significantly after having
 been shown the video: while only 2.6 percent of households in the control
 group report adopting this practice on at least one plot, this figure increases
 to 8.9 percent among households that were shown a video (and this difference
 is significant at the 1 percent FWER-corrected significance level).
 Similarly, we find that the proportion of households that removed striga
 early on increased from 68.5 percent to 74.7 percent as a result of being
 shown a video (randomization inference-based p-value of 0.020, significant
 at the 10 percent FWER-corrected significance level).
 Finally, while the proportion of households that reported having started
 weeding after 18-20 days is almost 2 percentage points higher among households
 that were shown the video, the difference is not significantly different
 from zero.
 Estimation results for the index that summarizes the different practices
 confirms that overall, we can conclude that the videos significantly increased
 the adoption of recommended practices.
 Results suggest this is particularly the case if it concerns practices
 that are new and less likely to be known by farmers.

 report results for the additional effect of the IVR encouragement, with
 estimates reported in column 4 and the corresponding randomization inference-ba
sed p-values in column 5.
 We do not find any significant additional effect of the IVR treatment on
 any of the recommended practices.
 The sixth and seventh column report results for the additional effect of
 the SMS campaign, with estimates reported in column 6 and the corresponding
 randomization inference-based p-values in column 7.
 While we do find that the proportion of households that reports to be removing
 striga before flowering is 2.4 percentage points higher in the treatment
 group, and while we also find a small positive effect on seed spacing and
 seeding rate, the differences are not significant.
 The fact that the both the IVR encouragement and the SMS campaign has no
 impact on adoption of practices is also reflected in the index estimation
 results.

Next, we examine results related to the use of modern inputs.
 During the endline survey, we collected detailed information on input use
 on the household's maize plots, specifically on the use of fertilizer and
 improved seed.
 Results are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 In the top panel of the table, we look at the three types of fertilizer
 that were recommended in the video separately, and again use an index to
 assess changes in overall fertilizer use.
 The first column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

 reports mean adoption rates in the control group.
 We find that 26.4 percent of control households report that they used DAP
 or NPK on at least one of their maize plots, while the use of urea is less
 widespread with only 5.1 percent of control households reporting urea use
 on at least one plot.
 Among control households, 15.7 percent reported using organic fertilizer
 on at least one plot.

 We see that the video treatment reduced the use of DAP or NPK by 4.7 percentage
 points.
 This difference has an associated randomization inference-based p-value
 of 0.088.
 However, it is not significant after controlling FWER.
 We find the opposite result for urea use with estimates indicating an increase
 of almost 5 percentage points (with a randomization inference-based p-value
 of 0.011, and significance at the 5 percent level after controlling FWER).
 We also find that the use of organic fertilizer increased by about 50 percent

 Summarizing the three types of fertilizer in a index results in a positive
 difference between treatment and control, with the difference significant

\begin_layout Standard
In the lower panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, we report results for the use of improved seed.
 We differentiate between maize hybrids and open-pollinated maize varieties.
 In the first column, we see that use of improved seed is more common than
 fertilizer use: in the control group, about 30 percent of households report
 using open-pollinated varieties on at least on plot, and this percentage
 is only slightly lower for hybrids.
 We do not find that the video treatment changes these percentages (columns
 2 and 3).
 However, we do find an effect from the IVR encouragement: the percentage
 of households that reported to have used hybrid seed on a least one plot
 was 4 percentage points higher in the treatment group.
 Apparently, providing farmers with a tool that allows them to actively
 seek out information about a new input or technology increases the likelihood
 that they also adopt hybrid maize seed.
 The impact of the IVR treatment on improved seed use is confirmed by the
 seed index.
 The SMS campaign appears to counteract the effect of the IVR on hybrid
 seed use.

Production effects

Finally, we now turn to the intervention's effects on production-related
 outcomes.
 We first examine household-level maize production.
 During the endline survey, we asked both spouses separately to estimate
 how much maize was harvested from each maize plot.
 These quantities were then summed over the different maize plots assessed
 by each spouse and the average between the two spouses was taken as the
 final estimate of household-level maize production.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:yield_ag_allh"

\end_inset

 shows mean values for the production indicators for the control group.
 On average, control households produce (log(kg)) 5.814 or about 440 kg of
 maize.
 This was cultivated on (log(acre)) 0.018 or about 1.19 acres on average.
 It also shows that for the average household in the control, maize yields
 (log(kg/acre)) equal 5.850 or about 430 kg/acre.
 This is much higher than yields recorded at baseline (290 kg/acre) for
 the previous season, possibly because rainfall patterns were better during
 our intervention and farmers may have given greater attention to combating
 fall armyworm.
 Still, compared to figures recorded in FAOSTAT (1000 kg/acre) or figures
 from household survey data (typically around 600 kg/acre), yields were
 below what might be considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in Uganda.
 This is also confirmed by the fact that in less than 40 percent of households
 at least one spouse reported that yields were better than a typical year
 on at least one plot.
 We also look at labor use.
 The average household spent about 72 person-days on maize farming, which
 includes labor that was hired in.
 This translates in a labor productivity of 6.73 kg of maize per hour worked.

In the second column of Table

 we report the impact of the video treatment (with corresponding randomization
 inference-based p-values in column 3) for the various production related

 We see that there is no impact on (log) maize production.
 However, we do see that households in the video treatment produced this
 same amount of maize on an area that is about 9.6 percent smaller than the
 area used for maize production by control households.
 As a result, we also find that among households in the video treatment,
 yields are about 10.3 percent higher than among the control group, and this
 difference is significant at 10 percent after controlling FWER.
 The fact that the video intervention has a clear effect on production-related
 outcomes is also reflected in the significant different in the production
 index (aggregating amount produced, area cultivated, labour used and a
 subjective assessment of maize yield) between treatment and control.
 That said, we do not find that households in the video treatment were more
 inclined to feel that yields are better than normal than control households.

Results are again consistent with the content provided in the video.
 In particular, the video advised that farmers experiment on a small part

 advised against using improved seed on their entire field if this does
 not leave sufficient money for complementary inputs such as fertilizer.
 Further, the video advised farmers to cultivate a more commercial mindset,
 paying ample attention to the idea of starting small and growing over time
 through re-investing.
 Columns 4 and 5 report the additive effect of the IVR treatment on production-r
elated outcomes.
 As with previous outcomes, there seems to be little impact from this treatment.
 Similarly, we do not find additional effects on production related outcomes
 of the SMS campaign.

\begin_layout Section*
Additional analysis and robustness tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we find significant effects from the video intervention, we find limited
 additional effects from the IVR and SMS treatments.
 In this section, we explore potential reasons for this and provide some
 further analysis to explore the robustness of our findings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Demand for IVR, SMS reception and Local Average Treatment Effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an encouragement design such as the IVR treatment, households self-select
 into the treatment.
 It may be instructive to look at differences in baseline characteristics
 between households that decide to make use of the IVR system and those
 that do not.
 The first column of Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Determinants-of-IVR"

\end_inset

 therefore shows the results of an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
 of an indicator that takes the value of one if the IVR system log showed
 that a household called in at least once using the phone number that was
 recorded during baseline data collection and zero otherwise on various
 baseline variables (and the SMS treatment allocation).
 Results show that none of the baseline characteristics predict demand for
 the IVR service, except for access to a mobile phone.
 We also find the SMS messages seemed to have increased the likelihood that
 farmers called the IVR hotline as intended.
 Even though farmers do not self-select into the SMS treatment, for mostly
 technical reason, the system reported that some messages could not be delivered
 to the intended recipients.
 We therefore ran a similar regression explaining SMS message reception
 by a range of baseline characteristics (second column of Appendix Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Determinants-of-IVR"

\end_inset

).
 Unsurprisingly, mobile phone ownership and access are the main determinants
 of SMS reception.
 However, we also find that larger households and households with better
 educated heads were more likely to receive the messages.
 This may be because these households reside in areas that have better network
 coverage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As demand for the IVR service (and to a lesser extent reception of SMS messages)
 is endogenous, we can not simply compare outcomes of households that called
 into the system to those that did not.
 Furthermore, it may be that farmers that were provided with information
 on the IVR passed this on to households that were shown the video but were
 not allocated to the IVR treatment.
 Contamination of the control group may lead to a downward bias of the treatment
 effect as estimated in the previous section.
 However, with two-sided non-compliance, Local Average Treatment Effects
 (LATE) can be estimated, where the random allocation the treatment is used
 as an instrument of the variable that measures calling into the IVR system

 In all these tables, means and standard deviations in the control group
 are repeated for reference in the first column.
 In the second column, results of a 2 stage least squares (2SLS) regression
 where we instrument a dummy variable that a household called the IVR with
 the random allocation to the IVR treatment, are reported.
 We report point estimates together with standard errors in brackets below;
 corresponding p-values are in the third column.
 The fourth column also shows point estimates and standard errors from the
 second stage of a 2SLS regression that instruments reception of at least
 one SMS message with the random allocation to the SMS treatment.
 The fifth column shows corresponding p-values and the last column shows
 the number of observations used.

Results do not change much from what we found in the previous section.
 For knowledge related outcomes and the use or recommended practices (Appendix

LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowLATE"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_late"

\end_inset

), point estimates for the IVR impact are generally much higher in absolute
 value, but remain insignificant.
 For the SMS treatment, LATE estimates are very similar to the intent to
 treat effects from the previous section.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_LATE"

\end_inset

 confirms the previous finding that the likelihood of using organic fertilizer
 reduces among households that called into the IVR system, but we now also
 find that this effect is reversed by the SMS messages.
 We now also find that SMS messages reduce the propensity to use of urea
 somewhat.
 For seed use, we find results similar to the previous section, with IVR
 increasing the likelihood of using hybrid seed but SMS reception reducing
 it again.
 Now the seed index is not significant anymore.
 Finally, few effects show up as significant when production related outcomes
 are considered (Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:prod_LATE"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, even after accounting for non-compliance, we find that additional
 effects from the IVR and SMS treatment are limited, particularly when judged
 by outcome indices.
 A first reason why we fail to find significant effects that are consistent
 with the effects from the video for the additional treatments may be because
 the partial compliance greatly reduces the power of the design.
 Only 8.9 percent of households that were selected for the IVR treatment
 also actually called in

A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that the minimum detectable effect
 (MDE) size for maize yields in the original IVR design would be about 6.4
 percent.
 With only 8.9 percent compliance, the MDE increases to 71.6 percent.

 in their analysis of different ICT enabled extension programmes in Kenya
 and Rwanda.
 In one experiment where farmers were offered to receive a call from an
 extension agent, only 8% of farmers requested a phone call during planting
 season.
 In another project, farmers also had access to a toll-free number, but
 only about 1% of treated farmers (35 callers) used it.

 For the SMS reminders, of the 1,113 households that were supposed to receive
 the reminders, 860 (77.3 percent) did, and so partial compliance seems less
 of a problem

 Contamination, where farmers that were allocated to the control group end
 up calling the IVR, may also lead to a downward bias in the estimates,
 making it harder to detect a significant impact.
 However, we find that only one percent of farmers that were allocated to
 the control group called the IVR hotline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rather, we suspect that LATE in our context would lead to an upward bias
 of the impact of the IVR.
 The reason is that our indicator of take up of the intervention is likely
 to be measured with significant error.
 In particular, our indicator of compliance is taken from the IVR system
 log, where recorded telephone numbers are matched to phone numbers that
 were recorded during baseline data collection.
 This indicator is likely to severely under-report true compliance, as encourage
d farmers may use different phones to call the IVR.
 This is illustrated by the fact that about 430 unique calls were made to
 the system, representing about 18 percent of encouraged households, hence
 almost doubling compliance.
 Using our measure of compliance, we can not maintain that the independence
 assumption holds, as some of the potential outcomes are directly determined
 by the instrument.
 The problem becomes clear when we think about LATE as the Wald estimator
 that scales the ITT by compliance.
 In our case, the ITT will be estimated on the basis of all 430 farmers
 that called in.
 Our measure of compliance will force all the impact of the treatment to
 work through the 214 households that show up in the IVR log and could be
 identified in the baseline, which in the case of a positive impact would
 lead to an overestimate of the impact of the treatment on compliers.
 It is well know that especially in the context of a weak first stage the
 bias can become extremely large

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A similar concern applies to our indicator of takeup of to SMS treatment.
 Here, however, we fear that compliance is overestimated and so IV estimates
 will result in a downward bias of the impact of the treatment on compliers.
 That is, our indicator of compliance is again derived from the system logs
 and simply looks at message delivery to the intended phone.
 Probably not all farmers also opened the messages and read them.
 But the problem is likely to be less severe here, given a stronger first
 stage and a likely smaller difference between measured compliance and real
 compliance.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The above may make interpretation of the LATE effects difficult.
 We thus recommend focusing on intent-to-treat effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Experimenter demand effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key concern with our study is the fact that we use self-reported survey
 data on key outcomes, as opposed to outcomes that are measured by a third
 party in an objective way.
 Study participants may report what they feel is desired in that context
 (social desirability bias).
 In an RCT, social desirability bias becomes a real concern if it is correlated
 to the treatment, which is sometimes referred to as experimenter demand
 effects 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "zizzo2010experimenter"

\end_inset

.
 While recent research suggests that experimenter demand effects may be
 less problematic than initially thought 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "eg."
key "de2018measuring,mummolo2019demand"

\end_inset

, we provide some discussion on why we feel experimenter demand effects
 are unlikely to drive our results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, during the design of the endline questionnaire, we tried to minimize
 potential experimenter demand effects by careful formulation of the questions.
 Experimenter demand effects are more likely to be a concern for simple
 yes/no questions than for more open ended questions.
 For instance, in our endline survey, we did not ask if farmers used 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plant spacing of 75cm x 30cm with a reduced seed rate of 1 seed per hill
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as recommended.
 Rather, we asked farmers to describe the planting process, and the enumerator
 was then asked to select the appropriate response from a list of options
 that was not revealed to the farmer.
 For input adoption, we started from broad questions (eg.
 whether fertilizer was used on a particular plot) and then asked farmers
 to go further into detail (eg.
 asking about fertilizer type, timing of application, quantities and price)
 allowing enumerators to detect inconsistencies that may signal experimenter
 demand effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, in our endline survey, not all outcomes are equally likely to be
 affected by experimenter demand effects.
 For instance, experimenter demand effects are probably less likely to be
 an issue for the multiple choice questions used to measure knowledge than
 for questions about implementation of recommended practices or the use
 of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer or improved seed.
 It is reassuring that there is consistency between effects found on questions
 that are more or less prone to experimenter demand effect.
 In other words, if we would have found that our interventions did not result
 in a change in knowledge related to optimal plant spacing, yet farmers
 report that they did use optimal plant spacing on their plots, we would
 be more worried that the latter effect was driven by experimenter demand
 effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, as we will report in the next section, fertilizer adoption, an outcome
 prone to experimenter demand effects, seems to increase particularly for
 treated farmers that live close to an agro-input dealer.
 This finding reduces the possibility that results are driven by misreporting
 related to experimenter demand effects, as this would mean that households
 that have better access to improved inputs strategically decide to report
 their answers differently than households that have less access to inputs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Heterogeneous treatment effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we explore potential differences in treatment effects condition
al on baseline characteristics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IVR and SMS treatments are probably more effective for households that have
 a mobile phone, and averaging outcomes over all household may dilute the
 treatment effect, making it more difficult to detect a significant difference
 between the treatment group and control group.
 Therefore, we also estimated (conditional) treatment effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the video intervention increases knowledge among the less educated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We further find that the positive effect of the video intervention on urea
 fertilizer use should be attributed to farmers that live relatively close
 to input shops (close being defined as less than 4 kilometers).
 This suggests that, in addition to information about the existence, use
 and benefits of this particular fertilizer, availability also seems to
 play a important role in the uptake of this technology.
 In line with this, distance to an agro-input shop does not seem to matter
 for organic fertilizer.
 We do not find a significant interaction between a proxy of wealth 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Attrition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following implementation of the field experiment, 342 households (or 8.63
 percent of the sample) could not be tracked or persuaded to complete the
 endline survey.
 Given the relative short time between baseline and endline, this is this
 is quite large.
 Attrition was 7.03 percent in the control group; 8.74 percent in the group
 that was shown a video; 8.90 percent in the group that was shown a video
 and received the IVR encouragement; and 7.45 percent in the group that also
 received an SMS in addition to the IVR encouragement and the video.

 presents a summary of a series of tests we did to investigate differential
 attrition.
 They relate to a series of regressions where an indicator of attrition
 is regressed upon treatment indicator and interactions with baseline characteri
stics.
 The first line looks at differential attrition among treatment groups more
 formally.
 The first column compares attrition between the control group and households
 that received the video intervention.
 A t-test shows no significant difference in attrition between these two
 groups

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The second column compares households that (also) received the encouragement
 treatment to those that did not (the control group and the video only group).
 Also here, there is no difference in attrition.
 We then compare attrition among the group that was allocated to the SMS
 treatment and also find no significant difference with households that
 were not allocated to the SMS treatment.
 In the final column, we implement a joint test of differential attrition
 across the treatment groups.
 We do so by running a regression of the attrition indicator on indicators
 of the three treatments and test if all estimated coefficients are zero.
 An F-test shows we can not reject the hypothesis of no differential attrition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We further investigate if attrition rates are correlated to baseline characteris
tics and whether this correlation differs by treatment group.
 We do this by regressing an indicator of attrition on the treatment indicator,
 the baseline characteristic and the interaction between the baseline characteri
stic and treatment.
 We then test if the interaction between treatment and baseline characteristic
 is significantly different from zero using a t-test.
 For instance in the first column of the second row, we do not find that
 attrition rates are related to baseline yields among households that received
 the video intervention.
 In the second column of the second row, also confirm that attrition rates
 are unrelated to baseline yields among households that received the IVR
 encouragement.
 The third column implements a similar test for the sms subgroup.
 Finally, in the last column, we test if coefficients on yield interacted
 each of the treatment dummies is jointly different from zero using an F-test.
 Also here, balance can not be rejected.
 These series of tests are repeated for each of the baseline characteristics
 that were included in Table

Cost-effectiveness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we did not collect detailed information on prices paid for inputs
 or wages.
 However, we can use the estimates above together with aggregate price data
 and some assumptions in a series of back-of-the-envelope cost and benefit
 calculations.
 We first check if the video intervention affected profitability of the
 average farmer and then compare the total cost of the intervention to the
 total benefit derived by the farmers in our study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our sample, a bag of 100 110 kg of maize was sold at a median price of
 UGX 60,000.
 We have seen that a control household reported yields of 430 kg per acre,
 with a corresponding value of UGX 258,000.
 In the sub-sample that received the video treatment, yields increase to
 474 kg per acre, corresponding to UGX 283,800.
 This means a difference in income of UGX 26,400 per acre, or about 7.5 USD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this, we subtract the cost of inputs.
 We recommended two hybrid seed, Longe 10H and UH5354 (commonly know Bazooka).
 At the time of the experiment, Longe 10H sold for UGX 6,000 per kg, while
 Bazooka costed UGX 8,500 per kg.
 However, the data shows that the use of Bazooka was marginal and not correlated
 to the treatment.
 We will therefor use only the price of Longe 10H in the cost calculations.
 We further recommended two open-pollinated varieties Longe 5 and Longe
 4.
 Among these two, Longe 5 is the most common variety.
 Both types costed about UGX 3,000 per kg.
 A farmer needs about 8 kg of seed to plant one acre.
 Inorganic fertilizers are probably the largest cost.
 The retail price of 1 kg of urea was about UGX 2,500, while DAP costed
 UGX 3,000 per kilo.
 We recommended using 60 kg of both DAP and Urea on one acre.
 We assume that organic fertilizer is free, but may increase labour cost
 (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recommended spacing and seed rate is unlikely to increase costs of seed.
 We recommend a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with one seeds per hill.
 We assume that most farmers would use 75cm x 60cm with two seeds per hill,
 leading to the same amount of seed needed per unit of land.
 We thus simply multiply the cost of these inputs by the likelihood that
 they are applied in both control and treatment group (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

) and subtract this from the income obtained from maize.
 Doing so actually increases the difference in income between treatment
 and control somewhat, as the likelihood that farmers use the more expensive
 fertilizer DAP reduced somewhat, while the likelihood that farmers use
 Urea increased.

 shows an increase in the practice of removing stirga early on, which is
 likely to increase labour.
 The new spacing recommendation also means more hills are needed, which
 may also have an impact on labour, as does the increased use of organic
 fertilizer.
 At the same time, we do not find that the video treatment is significantly
 correlated to the time spent on preparing the land (which includes application
 of inorganic fertilizer), to time spend on weeding, nor to the likelihood
 that labor is hired in.
 In addition, labour is very cheap at only 6,000 per day.
 Valuing work related to organic fertilizer adoption at 3 days, the adoption
 of the new planting method at 2 days and the work for weeding at 10 days
 (which is the time needed to weed one acre), the difference reduces to
 22,308 or about 6.4 USD.

The intervention overall costed close to USD 37,000.
 Almost 40 percent of this are fixed costs such as the production of the
 video (USD 6,300)

 and the cost of procuring 20 tablets at a total cost of USD 5,600.
 We also needed to train the enumerators at a total cost of 2,224.
 Variable costs are estimated to be about USD 2.77 for a single screening
 to an average farmer in the area.
 This includes time for the personnel showing the video and supervision
 time, car hire with driver, and fuel needed to reach the households.
 As a result, the intervention as implemented would only break even at about
 7,000 observations.
 If the intervention is rolled out to all 360,000 households in the 5 districts
 where the intervention was piloted, the internal rate of return would be
 about 34 %

It may be possible to reduce variable costs considerable.
 The largest component of the variable cost is the wage of of the person
 showing the videos to individual households.
 Currently, an extension worker with a bachelor's degree costs about the
 same of what we paid our enumerators.
 One may argue that one does not need to have a university degree to show
 a video, in which case extension workers with only a diploma an be used
 at roughly USD 77,000 per day.
 This would bring the variable cost down to about USD 2.36 for a single screening
 for the average farmer.
 Other cost savings may be obtained by showing videos to groups of farmers
 instead of individually, or direct streaming of videos to devices of farmers.
 However, this touches upon potentially important design features of the
 intervention than may alter outcomes, and as such require additional testing.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of three complementary ICT-mediate
d agricultural extension approaches that can be brought to scale relatively
 easily.
 The first approachâ€“the use of short, appealing video messages animated
 by farmer-actors who farmers can relate toâ€“is probably the approach containing
 the most substantial quantity of relevant information.
 While appealing because of its combination of both audio and visual information
, the approach is also somewhat supply-driven, assigning farmers to a passive
 role as the recipient of information.
 The second approachâ€“an interactive voice response (IVR) serviceâ€“allows
 the farmer to play a more active role in information acquisition by allowing
 the farmer to call into a system that offers menu-based choices leading
 to pre-recorded message.
 The third approach consists of a series of short message services (SMS)
 messages that reminds the farmer of particular key inputs or practicesâ€“provide
 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We test the effectiveness of these three ICT channels in an incremental
 fashion using a field experiment that involved nearly 4,000 smallholder
 maize farmers in eastern Uganda.
 To assess the effectiveness of the first channel, we compared outcomes
 of a random subset of farmers that was shown an informational video to
 a random subset of farmers that was shown a placebo video.
 From this initial treatment group, two-thirds of the farmers that were
 shown the video were randomly assigned to receive an IVR starter kit which
 encouraged them call into the IVR service to obtain information on maize
 cultivation that was consistent with the video's content.
 From this second treatment group, half were randomly assigned to receive
 a series of eight time-sensitive SMS reminders related to the recommended
 practices and technologies, along with a reminder to use the IVR service
 to obtain additional information.
 The design of this experiment allowed us to estimate the effect of the
 video treatment as well as the additional effects of the IVR encouragement
 and SMS treatments.
 Effectiveness was measured in terms of knowledge gained, practices and
 technologies adopted, and production increased.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Findings indicate that in our study site and context, video-enabled agricultural
 extension approaches affect a range of outcomes.
 Showing agricultural information videos to maize farmers increased knowledge
 outcomes, particularly on new practices and technologies, and increased
 the adoption of recommended practices, particularly those that were new
 and otherwise unknown to farmers.
 Videos also led to increased use of certain types of fertilizers (urea
 and organic).
 As a result, farmers that were shown agricultural information videos increased
 their maize yields by 10 percent.
 The IVR treatment offered in addition to the video treatment did not seem
 to additionally increase knowledge or adoption outcomes, although there
 is some evidence to suggest that farmers who received the IVR encouragement
 were more likely to use hybrid maize seed.
 We found no additional effect of being offered IVR on production.
 The SMS reminders provided in addition to the video treatment and IVR encourage
ment also did not have any additional effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different information technologies have different characteristics, making
 their effectiveness highly context specific.
 This may help explain why some components of our design seem to be effective
 for particular outcomes, while others are not.
 For instance, to introduce a new agronomic practice or technology (such
 as plant spacing of 75cm x 30cm with a reduced seed rate of 1 seed per
 hill), showing a video may be more effective than a demand-driven technology
 such as a hot-line, where farmers are assumed to be aware of their information
 needs.
 At the same time, a video shown on a tablet computer is generally a one-off
 intervention, and particular details such as the exact name and dose of
 a new type of seed may be missed or easily forgotten by farmers.
 Access to a demand driven information technology such as a hot-line may
 thus be more effective if agronomic practices are complex or require precise
 implementation.
 However, if there is no demand for such a technology (or take-up is constrained
 by other factors), information is also not disseminated.
 SMS messages are often framed as a supply-driven behavioral

nudge
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 designed to remind people to make decisions or take actions toward some
 particular objective.
 Timely reminders have often been found very effective in overcoming inertia,
 procrastination, competing obligations, or simple forgetfulness of human
 beings 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 However, SMS messages are short, which may be a problem when complex informatio
n needs to be disseminated.
 Farmers also need to be literate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lack of additional effects may be due to the way the experiment was
 designed.
 As we wanted to rule out any possibility that the effects were driven by
 differences in the content, we made sure that no new information was given
 in the IVR system and in the SMS campaign.
 In light of this, it may be less surprising that we do not find additional
 knowledge effects from the two interventions.
 This is also consistent with results from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "casaburi2014harnessing"

\end_inset

, who find only an impact from their SMS messages if it is more likely that
 the farmers do not already know the information that is contained in them.

Note: In the first column, means (and standard deviations) in the control
 group are presented for each variable.
 Column 2 reports differences between video only and video+ivr (and standard
 error) with its corresponding p-value in column 3 and number of observations
 in column 4; column 5 reports differences between video+ivr and video+ivr+SMS
 (and standard error) with its corresponding p-value in column 6; sample
 size is reported in column 7.
 Reported p-values are based on randomization inference (10,000 permutations);
 ***, ** and * denote that the difference is signficant at the 1, 5 and
 10 percent level, respectively, after correcting for multiple hypothesis
 testing using a family-wise sharp null (10,000 permutations).
 All specifications control for the other orthogonal factors in the factorial
 design.

Note: Column 1 reports differences between placebo and video treatment (and
 standard error between brackets below) for the outcome indicated to the
 left after all missing values due to attrition have been replaced by the
 minimum value of the outcome indicated to the left; Column 2reports differences
 between placebo and video treatment (and standard error) for the outcome
 after all missing values due to attrition have been replaced by the maximum
 value of the outcome; columns 3 and 4 report corresponding estimates (and
 standard error below) for differences between video only and video+ivr;
 columns 5 and 6 report corresponding estimates (and standard error below)
 for differences between video+ivr and video+ivr+SMS.
 All specifications control for the other orthogonal factors in the factorial
 design.
 For indices, missings were replaced in the variables that constitute the
 components of the index before the index was computed, so the bounds do
 not necessarily include the estimated coefficient.
