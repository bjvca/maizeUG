\begin_layout Title
Leveraging ICT to provide agricultural advice to smallholder farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Agricultural advisory services generally rely on interpersonal knowledge
 transfer, involving agricultural extension officers visiting farmers individual
ly or in groups.
 This approach is not always cost-effective and has often proved hard to
 bring to scale.
 Information and Communication Technologies have been advanced as a promising
 way to strengthen agricultural extension services.
 We test the effectiveness of three ICT-mediated models to transfer agricultural
 extension information.
 First, we investigate the effectiveness of video as means to transfer informati
on, increase technology adoption, increase productivity and improve well-being.
 Furthermore, we quantify the additional impact of augmenting video with
 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology—a more demand-driven approach
 to information provision.
 Finally, we measure the additional effect of sms reminders.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With new possibilities offered by information and communications technology
 (ICT), an abundance of pilot projects and commercial products have entered
 the market with a focus on revitalizing agricultural extension in developing
 countries.
 However, a growing body of evidence suggests that not all ICT-mediated
 extension approaches are equally effective in achieving outcomes such as
 increased knowledge and awareness, higher rates of technology adoption,
 better crop yields, and eventually improvements in household welfare.
 This may be because, as has been found in information campaigns more generally,
 seemingly small design attributes—the way information is delivered, who
 delivers the information, and who was targeted—can significantly influence
 these outcomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper investigates the effectiveness of an ICT-enabled extension approach
 designed to provide information about improved maize cultivation practices
 to smallholder farmers in Uganda.
 We consider the specific ICTs through which the information is delivered
 to the farmer, and differentiate between (i) short audiovisual messages
 viewed on tablet computers that provide detailed information on improved
 maize cultivation; (ii) interactive voice response (IVR) systems that farms
 call into if the need for additional information arises; and (iii) short
 message service (SMS) that nudge farmers at particular points in time about
 key farming practices they should apply.
 The outcomes used to assess the relative effectiveness of these different
 ICTs include increases in knowledge about improved maize cultivation by
 the subject farmer; and changes in household-level indicators such as the
 use of improved inputs, technologies, and practices; farm production and
 disposal; and well-being.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We draw on a field experiment in which farmers were randomly assigned to
 a group that received a particular ICT-mediated information interventions,
 and were then compared to a group that did not receive that particular
 information intervention 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 We work with almost 4,000 farm households sampled from the population of
 households cultivating maize across five districts of eastern Uganda.
 The core information intervention takes the form of a short video that
 explains simple yet effective ways to increase maize productivity and profitabi
lity, such as recommended practices in row spacing, the importance of quality
 seed, optimal soil fertility management, and farm budget management.
 To test the overall effectiveness of the information provided through the
 video medium, we compare outcomes of farmers who were exposed to a placebo
 video to outcomes of farmers who were shown the informational video.
 In addition, we provided access to an IVR system to about two-thirds of
 the sampled households who were shown the informational video and, within
 that group, we sent about half of the sampled households a series of eight
 follow-up SMS messages at strategic points in time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the farm household level, we find that providing information to farmers
 through short video messages increases their knowledge about modern inputs,
 improved technologies, and recommended practices.
 In addition, farmers who were shown the video are also more likely to adopt
 a range of inputs, technologies, and practices that were presented in the
 videos.
 We also find clear effects on production with maize yields 14 percent higher
 than in control households.
 However, these results do not translate into greater well-being.
 We also find that the IVR generates no additional impact on knowledge,
 nor does it have a strong influence on technology adoption: we only find
 a positive effect of IVR on the uptake of hybrid seed.
 Still, we do find that households that were allocated to the IVR treatment
 report yields that are 8 percent higher.
 We also find no effect from the SMS service.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
 The next section lays out the main research questions and corresponding
 hypotheses.
 Section 3 explains the experimental design and corresponding sampling frame.
 Section 4 describes the study site and context, while Section 5 describes
 the interventions used as the treatment in this experiment.
 We then turn to the results in Section 6 with a discussion of baseline
 characteristics and sample balance.
 This is followed by analysis of the household level impact of the technology
 used, with subsections for impact on knowledge, practices adopted, production,
 and welfare.

Research Questions and Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary focus of this study is to test alternative ways in which information
 is provided to farmers through ICT channels for improving the effectiveness
 of agricultural extension services.
 in encouraging the uptake and adoption of modern input use and improved
 crop management practices.
 Doing so, we aim to contribute to the literature on how ICTs can increase
 the uptake of improved management practices among smallholder farmers—a
 topic that has received considerable attention in recent years but has
 lacked sufficient evidence on which approaches work and for whom 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The role of ICTs in improving access to information on crop management—as
 compared to improving access to market and price information—is a particularly
 challenging topic.
 Information of this kind is often non-excludable and non-rival in nature,
 requiring government intervention when it is under-supplied by the private
 sector.
 Government intervention typically takes the form of information campaigns,
 extension programs, and advisory services, many of which have been met
 with mixed success

\end_inset

.
 These ambiguous outcomes are often associated with specificities of the
 technology, practice, or principle being promoted; the agroecological and
 socioeconomic context in which it is being promoted; and other confounding
 factors that may be poorly understood or too costly to address in program
 design and implementation.
 As a result, ICT applications to extension such as sms reminders, purpose-built
 smartphone apps, portable tablets and projectors, and other hardware and
 software solutions have received considerable attention in recent years
 as a means of addressing many of these issues

\begin_layout Standard
Several studies have reported positive impacts of ICTs applied to extension
 services.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 found that SMSs pushed to farmers in Gujarat, India generated positive
 effects on crop choice and pesticide-use decision, and that the introduction
 of an IVR system significantly increased cumin and cotton yields.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 services increased farmers' awareness and knowledge about specific solutions
 to their production constraints in Madhya Pradesh, India.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, on the other hand, found that while mobile phone-based animated videos
 shown to farmers in Burkina Faso induced learning and understanding, it
 was no more effective in encouraging adoption than conventional approaches
 to information provision.
 In Uganda—the site of our study—Grameen Foundation had some success using
 smartphones to provide agriculture-related information to farmers through
 ICT-empowered community knowledge workers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, while others have shown successful pilots with both short videos 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and mobile-phone hotlines for farmers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "RePEc:hbs:wpaper:13-047"

\end_inset

.
 However, it remains to be seen how far these effects can be generalized,
 and questions about cost-effectiveness, scalability, and accountability
 often remain unaddressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally and more broadly, we contribute to long-standing research efforts
 to document and measure the adoption and impact of improved agricultural
 technologies and management practices among smallholder farmers.
 There are many reasons for the observed low rates of adoption of improved
 technologies and practices among smallholder farm households, including
 lack of access to credit and insurance, poorly developed labour markets,
 and asymmetries of information within markets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1086/451461,jack2013market"

\end_inset

.
 Our contribution is methodological in nature in recognition of two important
 points.
 First, few studies apply sufficiently rigorous methods to address concerns
 about sample selection bias and causal identification in the study of technical
 change in developing-country agriculture 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2010recent"

\end_inset

.
 Second, few studies on ICT-enabled extension are replicated in differing
 contexts and populations to increase both generalizable findings and nuanced
 insights on the impact pathways through which ICT operates on farmers'
 decision-making about technology adoption.
 Our study adds to this growing body of literature by adapting a design
 tha is similar to work in progress in Ethiopia

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experimental design (described in detail below) allows us to explore
 these research questions by comparing outcomes between groups of randomly
 assigned farmers that are given the opportunity to view a video on improved
 maize management practices.
 In addition to the video, a random group of farmers also received a phone
 number and instructions to call into the IVR system.
 A final random subset of these farmers were also targeted by eight SMS
 messages reminding them at specific times about the application and use
 of important practices, and the fact that they can always call the IRV
 for additional information.

\begin_layout Standard
The three hypotheses are tested with a field experiment.
 The experiment was implemented as a 3 by 3 factorial design to which a
 separate control group was added.
 In the first part of the study, where we look at the effectiveness of different
 ICTs in delivering information, we only concentrate on a single factor
 that has three levels (plus the control).
 The three levels are incremental and consist of (in addition to the pure
 control): (i) being shown a video (

 allows us to test the three hypotheses outlined above.
 To evaluate the effectiveness of the different modes of information provision
 (H1), we start by comparing average household level outcomes among farm
 households in the control group to average outcomes of farming households
 that were shown a video, irrespective of who the video was shown to and
 who provided the information in the video.
 This gives us the average treatment effect for the video intervention.
 To get the additional effect of the IVR treatment, we compare average outcomes
 of households that were shown a video to households that were shown a video
 and received the IVR intervention as well.
 Finally, the additional effect of the SMS campaign can be estimated by
 comparing outcomes of households that are shown a video and received the
 information about the IVR system to outcomes of household that were shown
 a video, received IVR information and also received the eight SMS reminders.

\begin_layout Section*
Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conducted the field experiment among maize farmer in Uganda.
 Maize is widely consumed throughout much of Uganda, yet its value-to-weight
 ratio is sufficiently high to also make it an important traded commodity.
 Therefore, efforts to increase maize productivity at the farm-household
 level are an important dimension of Uganda's strategy to increase food
 security and reduce poverty through both consumption and income channels.
 Yet maize yields in Uganda are low when compared to neighbouring countries
 and global averages.
 While research station trials conducted in Uganda report potential yields
 of about 1.6 metric tons per acre (using only improved varieties without
 fertilizer application)
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
include reference
\end_layout

\end_inset

, data from the Uganda National Household Survey 2005/06 indicate that average
 maize yields are much lower at about 618 kg per acre for the main growing
 season.
 Moreover, there is considerable variation in productivity across farmers,
 with the top 10 percent of farmers achieving yields in excess of 1.1 metric
 tons per acre.
 At the same time, the use of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer
 and management practices such as row planting is very low in Uganda.
 For example, the use of inorganic fertilizer is on average just 2.4 kg of
 nutrient per acre per year, compared to Kenya (75 kg/ac), Rwanda (70 kg/ac),
 and Tanzania (15 kg/ac).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maize is especially important in eastern Uganda.
 We sampled from five districts in eastern Uganda known for their maize
 production: Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo, and Namutumba.
 From this, we removed town councils and also two sub-counties that consisted
 of islands in lake Victoria.
 We used two-stage cluster sampling to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, we first selected parishes randomly and in proportion to
 the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all the households, from which we sampled
 households to be included in the study.
 At the same time, we suspect that outcomes within villages will be correlated,
 for instance due to local weather conditions, or development programs that
 are implemented in certain areas.
 We therefore used the village as a blocking factor.
 In other words, in each village, we made sure all possible treatment combinatio
ns related to the two factors related to the messenger and recipient attributes
 (plus control) were administered.
 The experimental design described above shows that the messenger and the
 recipient factor combine into nine different treatment combinations.
 Adding the control leads to 10 different households being selected in each
 village.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In eastern Uganda, there are two maize cropping seasons.
 For our study, we concentrated on the second maize-growing season of the
 year 2017, which runs from approximately August 2017 to January 2018 and
 is characterized by a shorter period of rainfall than the first maize-growing
 season.
 During this second season, the complete cycle from planting to harvest
 requires 3 to 3.5 months, and farmers tend to cultivate early-maturing but
 lower yielding maize varieties as a result.
 Fields are prepared in August, planted in September.
 Harvesting begins in mid to late December and, at higher elevations, can
 continue until mid January.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Intervention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main intervention used in the study was a videos that was shown on 10-inch
 Android tablet computers.
 Videos were screened by a trained field enumerator who sat with individual
 farmers.
 The control group received a placebo treatment, which was a music video
 of traditional dancing that contained no information related to farming.
 Videos were screened twice to each person (or couple) in the sample, once
 before the time for planting maize (July 2017) and once around planting
 time (August 2017).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information contained in the treatment groups' video is expected to
 positively influence maize yields by encouraging the adoption of several
 improved technologies and practices which, in turn, are expected to positively
 affect farm-household income.
 The topics included in the video script were obtained from qualitative
 interviews with key informants that were conducted in May 2017, and included
 maize farmers, value chain actors, maize breeders, extension workers, district
 agricultural officers, and other government staff and experts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main factors affecting maize productivity that were identified by these
 key informants were related to pests, poor soils, and poor seed quality.
 The three most important 
\series bold
pests
\series default
 that affect maize farming are striga (in particular the 
\emph on
Striga hermonihica
\emph default
 variety), maize stalk borer (
\emph on
Busseola fusca
\emph default
), and, more recently, fall armyworm (
\emph on
Spodoptera frugiperda
\emph default
).
 We focus on striga management in the videos because it was deemed more
 immediately problematic to our population of interest than maize stalk
 borer, and because, at the time this field experiment was conducted, there
 was no consistent strategy being promoted to address fall armyworm.
 Striga, also called witchweed, is a parasitic plant that feeds off the
 roots of maize, leading to severe stunting of the maize plant.
 Because the nutritional needs of maize are greatest at the early stages
 of growth, weeding of striga becomes less effective in curbing losses as
 the season progresses.
 Striga can reduce production from about 30 percent up to total loss of
 the crop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No single method is effective in controlling striga.
 Progress has been made in developing varieties that are resistant to the
 herbicide imazapyr and can be supplied with a imazapyr seed coating to
 contain striga before it can damage the host plant.
 However, the seeds of this variety on offer in Uganda are expensive at
 10,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) per kg, while seeds of other common/popular
 varieties cost between 6,000 and 8,000 UGX/kg,

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 and does poorly under dry conditions and in areas where the rains are short
 such as in eastern Uganda.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the near future, it is expected that the same herbicide-resistance trait
 and seed-coating technology will be released in early-maturing varieties
 such as Longe 10, which are preferred in eastern Uganda.
 See https://striga.aatf-africa.org/.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Crop rotation with sweet potato or beans can also reduce striga infestation,
 as can applications of phosphatic fertilizer to make up for the nutrients
 drained by the parasitic weed.
 Weeding is also a strategy to control striga, and is most effective in
 the weed's earliest growth stages, before it establishes itself on the
 maize plant's root system and before it has a chance to spread via seed
 dispersal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Poor soils
\series default
, exhausted by continuous cultivation with little rotation, is the second
 main limiting factor.
 Soils often lack macro-nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P)
 and potassium (K), and farmers in our study area rarely use organic or
 inorganic fertilizers in sufficient quantities to ameliorate these deficiencies
, either at the planting stage (when diammonium phosphate (DAP) or nitrogen-phos
phorous-potassium (NPK) applications are recommended), or at the vegetative
 growth stage (when top dressings of nitrogenous fertilizers such as Urea
 are recommended).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout eastern Uganda, maize farmers mainly rely on 
\series bold
seed saved from harvest
\series default
, which represents the third limiting factor identifying by key informants.
 The reliance on saved (recycled) seeds tends to negate the significant
 yield advantages conferred by high-yielding maize hybrids, which require
 that new F1 seed be purchased at the start of each season to realize the
 gains conferred by heterosis or hybrid vigor.
 And even where farmers rely on recycled seed from improved open-pollinated
 varieties (OPVs) that do not require seasonal replacement, the gains from
 improvement tend to depreciate over three to four seasons, again requiring
 farmers to purchase new seed at regular intervals.
 Gains from the improved genetic qualities of both maize hybrids and OPVs
 can increase yields between 30 and 200 percent, depending on climatic condition
s and the complementary use of modern inputs and intensive management practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, there are also
\series bold
 crop management practices
\series default
 that affect yields, but the effects are generally smaller than those related
 to improved seeds and inorganic fertilizer use.
 The most important are timely planting, optimal plant spacing, and timely
 weeding.

\series bold
Timely planting
\series default
 in eastern Uganda implies that maize should be planted at the onset of
 the rains.
 However, many farmers delay planting for several reasons.
 For instance, they may not be certain that the rainy season has really
 started.
 There may also be bottlenecks in land preparation, where poorer farmers
 are often the last in line for the use of oxen or tractors.
 Experts estimate that for each day a farmer delays planting, yields are
 reduced by 1.5 percent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Optimal plant spacing
\series default
 implies that sowing should be structured so that plants are not too close
 to each other such that they compete for light and nutrients which, in
 turn, reduces yields.
 Plants that are too far from each other means space is wasted, also leading
 to lower yields.
 Related is the number of seeds that farmers plant in each hill.
 Farmers want to be sure of germination and put more than one seed, sometimes
 up to 5.
 If they all germinate, there is competition for nutrients and sun, resulting
 in stunted growth.
 Usually there is also not enough thinning, or this is done too late when
 competition has already occurred.
 One expert told us that standard spacing is 75cm x 60cm with two plants
 per hill.
 However, several experts mentioned a new way of plant spacing of 75cm x
 30cm with a reduced seed rate of 1 seed per hill which leads to a 35 percent
 increase in yields.

\series bold
Timely weeding
\series default
 implies that the first weeding should be done at 18 to 20 days after planting,
 with a second weeding at two to three weeks after first weeding.

 stage (when the maize is at about knee height), the maize plant is a very
 poor competitor and unwanted stress such as weed competition must be prevented.
 A third weeding at the tasseling stage is optional, and depends on observed
 weed pressure after the second weeding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the above, a significant portion of the videos focuses on providing
 technical information on seed choice, soil nutrient management (including
 the promotion of both organic and inorganic fertilizer application), weeding
 (with particular attention on fighting striga), timely planting, and plant
 spacing.

Note that the videos did not include explicit information on the use of
 chemical pesticides which can be effective in addressing pests but may
 also be hazardous to humans, animals, and the environment.
 The decision to exclude such information was made following a determination
 by the study team that currently available content on pesticide use was
 insufficiently attentive to issues of safe handling, application, storage,
 and disposal of pesticides that are warranted in any study involving human
 research subjects.

 We made sure to include information that is likely to be unknown to the
 farmer, based on findings from other studies that information is most valuable

However, not all constraints to maize productivity improvement are information
 deficiencies directly related to the use of inputs, technologies, and crop
 management practices.
 Often, missing information problems manifest indirectly, as uncertainty
 about the distribution of the farm-household's profit function.
 This includes uncertainty about the correlations between expected and actual
 returns, the inter-temporality of income streams, estimates of fixed and
 variable costs, hidden transactions costs, probabilities of adverse events,
 and a range of other variables that farmers may simply be unable to conceptuali

Farmers indeed often mention they do not use modern inputs because they
 have no money, suggesting liquidity is the main constraining factor, and
 thus instead of providing information, a more effective strategy would
 be to provide credit or subsidize inputs.
 Recent research, however, finds that despite what farmers claim, liquidity
 is often not the most important constraining factor.

 attributed to the farmer's failure to commit.

 Thus, a significant portion of the videos also focuses on the costs and
 benefits of the different technologies and practices being promoted.
 In addition, the videos encourage long-term thinking, advising farmers
 to (a) start small and grow their farm enterprise over time, and (b) combine
 technologies and practices together rather than investing all of their
 money and effort into one single input, practice, or technology.
 In short, we encourage them to experiment with combinations of technologies
 and practices on a small scale in the initial season before reinvesting
 their gains for larger-scale replication in subsequent seasons.

\begin_layout Standard
We also pay attention to how the information is packaged.
 For instance, it is found that farmers find communicators who face agricultural
 conditions and constraints most comparable to their own to be the more
 persuasive than other communicators

 and who provide information that is framed as a success story.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The video starts with the farmer-actor or -actors introducing themselves
 (recall that three versions of this video were produced: one where the
 farmer-actor is male; one where the farmer-actor is female; and one where
 a pair of actors, one male and one female, act together).
 The farmer-actor talks about how she used to struggle with her maize production
 and how at one point in time, she decided things needed to change.
 It is shown how the farmer sells a hen, obtains a small loan from a friend,
 and uses these proceeds to buy small quantities of improved seed and fertilizer
 from a local retailer.
 The video then shows how the farmer prepares the field by collecting and
 applying manure.
 Next, the video details how the DAP is applied correctly, how maize seed
 are spaced at 75cm x 30cm intervals with 1 plant per hill, and what the
 correct timing of these activities should be.
 The video progresses to a field about 10 to 12 days after sowing when the
 maize has emerged from the soil, and the farmer-actor recommends to engage
 in gap filling to replace seeds that did not germinate, thereby preserving
 optimal plant density.
 The video proceeds to the field at 18 to 20 days after sowing, and the
 farmer-actor recommends how weeding should be conducted with particular
 attention to the identification of striga and the importance of follow-up
 weeding two to three weeks later.
 The video then advances to four weeks after planting, where the farmer-actor
 demonstrates how Urea top dressing is done and recommends one more round
 of weeding at the tasseling stage.
 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The video then turns to a discussion about investing to get higher yields
 over time.
 The farmer-actor points out that while it may be difficult to raise cash,
 one can always start small (e.g., on one tenth of an acre) and reinvest the
 returns.
 She then explains that following recommended practices and using improved
 inputs led her to produce 2.5 bags of maize on a small plot, which she sold
 for UGX 125,000 with a profit of almost UGX 90,000—as compared to previously
 harvesting merely one bag from the same area at a profit of only UGX 40,000.
 She then explains that she reinvested the difference (UGX 50,000) to increase
 the area under intensive maize cultivation year after year such that, over
 time, she was able to cultivate an entire acre using modern inputs.
 In the final part of the video, she reiterates her experience and again
 encourages the viewer to try a similar approach.

Two other treatments were incrementally added to the video treatment.
 For these two treatments, the IVR system and the SMS messaging, we collaborated
 with viamo, a social enterprise that aims to connect individuals and organizati
ons using digital technology to make better decisions.
 We set up an IVR system that provided the same information as what we recommend
 in the video (eg.
 the new way of spacing, the same types of hybrid and OPV seed,...).
 Farm households that were allocated the the IVR treatment could call a
 toll free number which explained the IVR system in their own language.
 the caller is then invited to select the number corresponding to the topic
 on which s/he wants more information (e.g.
 1 for seed selection, 2 for spacing and seed rate, 3 for soil nutrient
 management, 4 for advice on weeding, 5 for pest management).
 Depending on what number was selected, the IVR then played an audio message
 of a conversation between two farmers where one farmer is telling the other
 farmer the recommended practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the SMS campaign, we recorded telephone numbers for each household on
 which the household could be reached.
 Households that were allocated to the SMS treatment were sent eight SMS
 messages over the course of the two months following the first screening
 of the video.
 The messages all followed a similar structure, where farmers were first
 reminded about the important technology or practice that was relevant at
 the particular time that the message was sent, followed by a reminder about
 the existence of the IVR service.
 For example, the first message, that was sent out around planting time,
 read

 similar studies have used in their orthogonality tests.
 In particular, we looked at balance tables in studies that investigate
 the adoption of yield improving methods and technologies using randomized

 We collected household characteristics such as household size, age, and
 education level of household head.
 We then asked more specific questions related to maize farming, such as
 acreage and quantities produced in the last season.
 Furthermore, we asked if the household received agricultural extension
 service, whether it used improved seed, and whether fertilizer was applied.
 We also collected data on housing conditions (number of bedrooms) and distance
 to the nearest agro-input shop.
 As mobile phone ownership is relevant to the IVR and SMS interventions,
 we also report balance household level on access to a mobile phone and
 ownership.

In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance"

\end_inset

, we provide descriptive statistics and balance tests for the three hypotheses
 related to the ICT used to deliver the information.
 Averages for the control group are reported in the first column.
 We observe that few households that were included in our study had access
 to agricultural extension in the previous year (about 11 percent).
 We also observe that only about 17 percent of households reported to have
 used any fertilizer in the previous season and only about 34 percent reported
 to have used improved seed bought from a shop or agro-input dealer during
 the last cropping season.
 This suggests ample scope to increase intensification investments through
 extension.
 We also find that farmers produced on average only 268 kg of maize per
 acre in the first cropping season of 2017.
 This is substantially lower than the average yield of 618 kg per acre we
 find in data from the 2005/06 Uganda National Household Survey.
 The low yields may reflect the devastating impact of the Fall Armyworm
 outbreak in East Africa in 2017, but maybe also be the result of adverse
 weather conditions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Balance is tested through calculating differences between treatment groups
 for each characteristic, as well as through a joint significance test (F-test)
 for each of the three ICTs.
 The second column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance"

\end_inset

, denoted video, compares baseline characteristics between households that
 were shown the placebo video and household that were shown an intervention
 video.
 For example, we see that yields prior to the intervention are about 20
 kg per acre higher in the group that was shown the video than in the group
 that was not shown the placebo video.
 However, this difference is not significantly different from zero.
 In fact, for the placebo video versus intervention video comparison, none
 of the differences between baseline characteristics is significant at the
 5 percent significance level, and also the F-statistic can not be rejected.
 In the third column, differences in baseline characteristics between households
 that received the intervention video and households that received IVR on
 top of the video are shown (indicates as +IVR).
 Here, we see that households in the latter group are significantly larger
 than households that only saw the video.
 They also have significantly more bedrooms.
 However, we can again not reject the null that jointly, baseline characteristic
s are unrelated to the treatment group for this comparison.
 For the final hypothesis related to the technology tested (comparing farmers
 that received video and IVR to those that additionally received SMS messages;
 reported in column four and denoted +SMS), we again find no significant
 differences in baseline characteristics, both for individual and joint
 comparisons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that about 84 percent of households have access to a mobile phone.
 This is encouraging, as the usefulness of IVR depends on access to a mobile
 phone.
 We find that there is no difference in this percentage between the various
 treatment groups.
 The incidence of phone ownership is also high, with about three quarters
 of households reporting they own a mobile.
 Again, this is important as the success of the SMS intervention depends
 on being able to receive the messages.
 Overall, we conclude there may be some concern about balance when comparing
 the video only group to the video+IVR group, something we will further
 investigate when we look at the robustness of some of the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Attrition was low.
 Only 8.63 percent of the sample could not be tracked or persuaded to complete
 the endline survey.
 In addition, there were no indications that attrition rates were different
 between the different treatment groups.
 Attrition was 7.03 in the control group; 8.74 percent in the group that was
 shown a video; 8.90 percent in the group that was shown a video and received
 the IVR encouragement; and 7.45 percent in the group that also received
 an SMS in addition to the IVR encouragement and the video.
 Only in among the households that received the SMS reminders, attrition
 is slightly lower than among households that did not receive the SMS treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Intent to Treat Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with an elaborate analysis of the Intent to Treat effects of the
 three technologies.
 For the first technology, video, we had virtually no household that refused
 to watch, and so the Intent to Treat effect is equivalent to the average
 treatment effect of the technology.
 This is not necessarily the case for the two other additional technologies.
 For instance, the IVR treatment consists of an encouragement to use the
 IVR system.
 We can not simply ignore the fact that a large proportion of farmers that
 were encouraged to use the IVR ended up not calling the system, as they
 are likely to be a non-random subset of the households that were assigned
 to the IVR treatment, leading to a biased estimate of the impact of the
 IVR technology.
 For instance, households that did not call may be lower educated than those
 that did call.
 Comparing average knowledge levels between groups who called the IVR and
 those that did not may reveal that the group that did not call has lower
 knowledge, yet it would be unclear if this is due to the fact that did
 not get information through the IVR or whether this is due to their lower
 level of education.
 Also for the third treatment, the SMS reminders, being allocated the treatment
 does not necessarily mean that the household also receives the SMS message.
 For instance, we have evidence that some messages did not reach the intended
 recipient.
 Also here, the probability that a particular household does not receive
 the intended treatment is likely non-random.
 For instance, households that live further away from a mobile phone tower
 may be more likely to experience technical issues leading to delays or
 non-delivery of the SMS message.
 Even though we feel that, from a policy perspective, the Intent to Treat
 analysis is the most informative, we also present additional analysis later
 in the article in an attempt to get a better estimate of the effectiveness
 of the different technologies itself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Impact on knowledge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first test the impact of the three different ICT interventions on knowledge.
 This was done through a short quiz 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "feder2004acquisition,feder2004sending,masset2015does"

\end_inset

 consisting of four questions that were asked during the endline survey
 to each of the two spouses in the farm household separately.
 For each question, three possible answers were read out to the respondent,
 who was then asked to indicate which answer he or she though was correct.
 The respondent was also allowed to indicate if he or she did not know the
 correct answer.
 The household was considered knowledgeable on a particular topic if at
 least one of the spouses indicated the correct answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first question was related to planting.
 In our video, we recommended a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with 1 plant per
 hill, and this was the correct option.
 Other possible answers included a spacing of 75cm x 60cm with two plants
 per hill, which is standard for many farmers and recommended by many agricultur
al extension agents, and an intermediate alternative of 75cm x 30cm with
 2 seeds per hill.
 Because our video recommended a technique that deviates from what is assumed
 to be standard spacing, we assume that the recommended practice is new
 to most of the farmers.
 The second question is less related to technical knowledge, but more to
 viewing farming as a business.
 In the video, we paid ample attention to promoting an approach where farmers
 start small and grow over time by reinvesting, and we emphasized the benefits
 of combining inputs rather than investing only in e.g., improved seed.
 We want to see if farmers internalize this advice and ask what a successful
 farmer would do if he or she only has 40,000 shillings.
 The correct answer is to use this sum to purchased improved seed and fertilizer
 and start intensified farming on a small area.
 Alternative options were to: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

use all the money to buy hybrid seeds, because without good seeds, yields
 will be low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

use all the money to buy fertilizer, because with poor soils, yields will
 be low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For the third questions, we asked if they knew when weeding is most important.
 The video showed that weeding is most important during the first four weeks
 after planting, as maize is a poor competitor for light and nutrients.
 It is assumed that most farmers would know this.
 Alternative answers were: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when the maize is knee high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

when the maize is at tasseling stage,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Finally, we asked if farmers knew when spraying against Fall Armyworm is
 most effective.
 There was no information given about fighting Fall Armyworm in the intervention
, so unless one of our interventions encouraged farmers to search for additional
 information, we do not expect an impact.
 For this question, the correct option was: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

During the evening, as fall armyworm eats during night,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while the other options were: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Early in the morning when it is still cool
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
To guard against over-rejection of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference
, outcomes of the four knowledge questions were combined into an index,
 constructed as the weighted mean of the individual standardized outcomes,
 using as weights the inverse of the co-variance matrix of the transformed
 outcomes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 However, we also think it is interesting to look at the impact on the questions
 individually, as the questions were designed.
 To control the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER), we use re-randomization to
 construct the joint null distribution for the family of outcomes we are
 testing.
 From this family-wise sharp null, we can obtain the corresponding FWER-consiste
nt significance thresholds by determining which cuttoffs yield e.g., 5 percent,
 1 percent and 0.1 percent significant hypothesis tests across all tests
 and simulations.

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowh0HH"

\end_inset

 shows results for the three incremental levels of ICT-mediated information
 delivery using different dissemination technologies.
 The first column reports mean (and standard deviation reported below in
 parentheses) scores in the control group.
 For the four individual questions, this is simply the proportion of households
 that answered correctly on the particular question.
 For instance, we find that in 16 percent of the households in the control
 group, at least one of the spouses gave the correct answer among the response
 options to the question on optimal maize seed spacing.
 This relatively low rate of correct responses is due to the fact that this
 is a fairly new and potentially controversial recommendation.
 We find that in about 91 percent of households, at least one spouse know
 inputs were best combined and in more than 95 percent of households it
 was known that weeding is most important during the first 4 weeks.
 In about one third of the households, at least one spouse knew how to fight
 fall armyworm.
 For the knowledge index, the mean is harder to interpret, as it is the
 result of a weighted mean after standardization of the individual components
 of the index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second column, we report the impact of having been shown the video
 (with standard error of the estimated coefficient reported below in parentheses
).
 We see that having been shown the video increases the likelihood that at
 least one individual knows the recommended spacing by 12.6 percentage points
 and this difference is significantly different from zero at the 1 percent
 FWER adjusted significance level (randomization inference based p-value
 are in the third column; significance stars denote significance as compared
 to FWER adjusted thresholds).
 We also find that the video increased the likelihood that at least one
 spouse indicates that inputs are best combined for optimal results by 5
 percentage points.
 This difference is statistically significant at the 5 percent FWER adjusted
 significance level.
 For the question on weeding, the intervention does not seem to have a significa
nt effect.
 However, this result should be interpreted with care due limited variation
 in the outcome.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In fact, our pre-analysis plan specified that we would drop from the analysis
 variables where 95 percent of outcomes are the same value.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Finally, on the Fall Armyworm question, we find that households that were
 shown the video are no more likely than control households to know when
 one should spray to control the pest.
 This suggests that the videos did not encourage farmers to actively search
 information on important challenges that were not explicitly covered in
 the video.
 Overall, and as confirmed by the knowledge index, we conclude that the
 agricultural extension videos increased knowledge at the household level,
 and that this increase seems especially poignant for 
\emph on
new
\emph default
 information provided in the videos.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fourth column (+IVR) shows the additional (ITT) effect of IVR (with
 standard error of the estimated coefficient reported below in parentheses;
 corresponding randomization inference based p-value are in the fifth column),
 over and above the video effect reported in the second column.
 We see that being provided with an IVR encouragement does not affect knowledge
 about the new recommended spacing.
 There is some indication that the IVR treatment reduces the likelihood
 that at least one spouse responded correctly on the question about how
 inputs should be combined, but the reduction is not significantly different
 from zero after taking multiple inference into account.
 Similarly, there is no effect on knowledge related to the optimal time
 for weeding and also no effect on knowledge about the best way to fight
 fall armyworm.
 The fact that there is no effect of the IVR encouragement is confirmed
 by the knowledge index.
 The sixth column (+SMS) reports the additional effect of the sms reminders
 on the various questions and the index (randomization inference based p-value
 are in the seventh column).
 Similar to the impact of IVR, we do not find an additional effect of the
 SMS campaign on any of the questions.
 We also do not find an effect of the SMS campaign as judged by the knowledge
 index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be that the null results for both IVR and SMS campaign are due to
 the fact that we average over both households that have access to a mobile
 phone and those who do not.
 Therefore, we take a closer look at conditional treatment effects.
 In particular, for the IVR campaign, we re-estimate the impact on knowledge
 again, but only for the 3,000 households that reported to have access to
 a mobile phone (either because someone within the household owns a mobile
 phone or because they can use the phone of a neighbor or relative if necessary).
 For the SMS campaign, access to a mobile phone is likely not sufficient.
 To get the most benefit from the SMS reminders, households need to own
 a mobile phone.
 We therefor reran the analysis for the subset of 2,734 farm households
 that reported to own a mobile phone.
 However, results, reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowh0HH-1"

\end_inset

, are very similar to the results obtained from the analysis on the entire
 data set, with no additional effects from neither IVR nor SMS reminders
 on knowledge.

Adoption effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the endline survey, we collected detailed information on adoption
 of recommended farming practices on maize plots.
 Results of mean adoption rates in the control group for different practices
 are reported in the first column of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_h1_ag"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, in the video, we recommend to start planting maize immediately
 after the start of the rains.
 We find that 37 percent of households in the control group reported that
 they started planting one day after the start of the rains on at least
 on plot.
 Below, we show that only 2.6 percent of households in the control group
 used the recommended way of plant spacing of 75cm x 30cm with a reduced
 seed rate of 1 seed per hill.
 This low rate in the control group is not surprising given that this was
 a new and somewhat controversial recommendation.
 Almost 69 percent of control households report removing striga before it
 flowers to reduce damage early on and prevent the weed from spreading.
 Finally, we find that about 43 percent of control households reported first
 weeding after 18-20 days as recommended in the video.

The second column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 again reports the difference in the adoption of practices between households
 that were shown the video and households that were give the placebo treatment
 (with standard error of the estimate in parenthesis below; corresponding
 randomization inference based p-values are in column 3).
 We find that for the first recommended practice, early planting, there
 is no impact from the agricultural extension information video.
 The likelihood that households adopt the recommended 75cm x 30cm spacing
 with a reduced seed rate increases significantly after having been shown
 the video: While only 2.6 percent of households report adopting this practice
 on at least one plot, this percentage increases to 9.1 percent in the group
 of households that was shown a video (and this difference is significant
 at the 1 percent FWER corrected significance level).
 Similarly, we find that the proportion of households that removed striga
 early on increased from 68.5 percent to 75.2 percent as a result of being
 shown a video (randomization inference p-value of 0.017, significant at
 the 10 percent FWER corrected significance level).
 Finally, while the proportion of households that reports they started weeding
 after 18-20 days is almost 3 percentage points higher among households
 that were shown the video.
 However, the difference is not significantly different from zero.
 The index that summarizes the different practices confirms that overall,
 we conclude that agricultural extension videos significantly increased
 the adoption of recommended practices.
 Results suggest this is particularly the case if it concerns practices
 that are new and less likely to be known by the farmers.

The fourth and fifth column of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 report results for the additional effect of the IVR encouragement (Intent
 to treat estimate in column 4, corresponding randomization p-values in
 column 5).
 We do not find any significant additional effect of the IVR treatment on
 any of the recommended practices.
 The sixth and seventh column report results for the additional effect of
 the SMS campaign (Intent to treat estimate in column 6, corresponding randomiza
tion p-values in column 7).
 While we do find that the proportion of households that reports to be removing
 striga before it flowers is slightly higher in the treatment group and
 we also find a small positive effect on seed spacing and seed rate, the
 differences are not significant.
 The fact that the both the IVR encouragement and the SMS campaign has no
 impact on adoption of practices is also reflected in the index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the analysis for knowledge outcomes, we repeated the analysis
 to assess the sensitivity of our results to potential treatment heterogeneity
 related to mobile phone access.
 In particular, we redid the analysis for the additional effect of IVR encourage
ment, but only for the households that reported to have access to a mobile
 phone.
 Results for this are reported in columns 2-4 in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_cate"

\end_inset

.
 In addition, we repeat the analysis for the additional impact of the SMS
 campaign, but restricting our sample to only the households that reported
 owning a mobile phone.
 Results for this are in columns 5-7.
 Results are very similar to those reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_h1_ag"

\end_inset

 and so we conclude that our lack of results are driven by treatment heterogenei
ty with respect to mobile phone ownership or access.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also asked detailed questions on the adoption of modern inputs.
 In particular, we examine the effect of video-enabled extension on fertilizer
 and seed use on maize plots.
 Results are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

.
 In the top panel of the table, we look at the three types of fertilizer
 that were recommended in the video separately, and again use an index to
 assess changes in overall fertilizer use.
 Again, the first column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

 reports mean adoption rates in the control group.
 We find that 26.4 percent of households reports that they used DAP or NPK
 on at least on of their maize plots.
 We also find significantly less households are using Urea: only 5.1 percent
 of households in the control group report that they used Urea on at least
 one crop.
 Among control households, 15.7 percent reports using organic fertilizer
 on at least one crop.

The impact of showing agricultural extension videos on fertilizer use is
 reported in column 2 and 3 of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 We see that showing a video reduced the use of DAP or NPK by 5.3 percentage
 points.
 This difference has an associated randomization inference based p-value
 of 0.066.
 However, it is not significant after controlling FWER.
 We find the reverse for Urea use: here, we record a increase of almost
 4 percentage points (randomization inference based p-value of 0.063, but
 again not significant after controlling FWER).
 We also find that the use of organic fertilizer increases by almost 50
 percent as a result of the video treatment.
 Summarizing the three types of fertilizer in a index results in a positive
 difference between treatment and control, but the difference is not significant
 at the 10 percent level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The opposing effects of the video on different types of fertilizer, the
 inorganic types in particular, may be due to the fact that in the video,
 we pay particular attention the benefits of combining inputs and technologies.
 The video may thus encourage farmers to reassess their mix of fertilizers,
 reducing the use of fertilizer types that are already used widely and increasin
g the use of fertilizer types that are less commonly used.
 In the light of this reasoning, the fertilizer index may need to be specified
 differently, as more is not necessarily better for each type of fertilizer.
 More in particular, in the light of the imbalance in the control group,
 one may argue that DAP/NPK use is higher than optimal and Urea use is lower
 than optimal.
 As such, a case can be made to include DAP/NPK use in the index with a
 negative sign.
 Doing so, we conclude that the video intervention has a significant effect
 on the fertilizer mix used by farmers (with a randomization inference p-value
 < 0.001).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The supplementary impact of the IVR encouragement is reported in columns
 4 and 5 of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

.
 While the difference between treatment and control is positive for both
 types of inorganic fertilizer, the effects are not significant.
 We do, however, find that the IVR encouragement reduced the proportion
 of households that reports using organic fertilizer by almost 24 percent.
 This negative impact may again be explained by a change in the mix of fertilize
r.
 In the context of a more demand driven technology, farmers that use organic
 fertilizer may seek information on more efficient types of fertilizers.
 If we judge the effectiveness of the IVR encouragement by including organic
 fertilizer use in the index with a negative sign, we do indeed find a significa
nt impact (randomization inference p-value = 0.009).
 The additive effect of the SMS campaign is reported in columns 6 and 7
 of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

.
 We find that the SMS reminders reduced the likelihood of using Urea (randomizat
ion inference based p-value = 0.099) but the effect is not significant after
 accounting for multiple comparisons.
 The index also shows no effect of the SMS campaign on fertilizer use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the lower panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

, we report results for the use of modern seed.
 We differentiate between hybrid seed varieties and open pollinated varieties.
 In the first column, we see that use of improved seed is more common than
 fertilizer use: in the control group, about 30 percent of households report
 using open pollinated varieties on at least on plot, and this percentage
 is only slightly lower for hybrid varieties.
 We do not find that having been shown a video changes these percentages
 (columns 2 and 3).
 We do find an effect from the IVR encouragement: the percentage of households
 that reported to have used hybrid seed on a least one plot was 4.1 percentage
 points higher in the treatment group.
 Apparently, providing farmers with a tool that allows them to actively
 seek out information about a new and complicated technology increases the
 likelihood that they that they adopt it.
 The impact of the IVR treatment on improved seed use is confirmed by the
 seed index.
 The addition of SMS reminder, on the other hand, does seem to reduce the
 likelihood that hybrid maize seed is used (columns 6 and 7).
 However, the effect ceases to be significantly different from zero after
 controlling FWER.
 The effect of the SMS campaign on the seed index is also insignificant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We again investigate robustness of the results for the IVR and SMS interventions
 by rerunning the analysis conditional on mobile phone ownership.
 The results from this analysis is presented in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_CATE"

\end_inset

.
 We find that for the subset of households that have access to a mobile
 phone, the IVR encouragement still reduces the likelihood of using organic
 fertilizer and increases the use for DAP/NPK (but not for Urea).
 That said, if we include organic fertilizer use with a negative sign in
 the index, we still conclude that the IVR treatment significantly affects
 fertilizer allocation (randomization inference p-value=0.006).
 The addition of SMS reminders reduces Urea use more in the subgroup of
 phone owners (randomization inference p-value=0.044), but the estimate is
 not significantly different from zero after controlling FWER.
 Judged by the fertilizer index, there is also no additional effect of SMS
 on fertilizer use.
 The effect of the IVR treatment on seed use becomes insignificant if we
 restrict ourselves to the subset of farmers that have access to a mobile
 phone, while the negative effect of the SMS campaign on hybrid seed use
 now becomes significant at the 10 percent FWER controlled significance
 level.

Production effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now turn to the intervention's effects on production-related outcomes.
 We first look at household-level maize production.
 During the endline survey, we asked both spouses separately to estimate
 how much maize was harvested from each plot.
 These quantities were then summed over the different maize plots for each
 spouse and the average between the two spouses was taken as the final estimate
 of household-level maize production.
 We find that overall, a typical household in our sample produced about
 500 kg of maize on an average of 1.16 acres.
 We further find that yields, defined as kilograms per acre, amounted to
 on average 530 kg per acre.
 This is much higher than yields recorded at baseline (290 kg/acre) for
 the previous season, possibly because the rains were better during our
 intervention and farmers may have given greater attention to combatting
 Fall Armyworm.
 Still, compared to figures recorded in FAOSTAT (1000 kg/acre) or figures
 from household survey data (typically around 600 kg/acre), yields were
 below what might be considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in Uganda.
 This is also confirmed by the fact that in less than 40 percent of households
 at least one spouse reported that yields were better than a typical year
 on at least one plot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:yield_ag_allh"

\end_inset

 shows mean values for the production indicators.
 It shows that on average in the control group, households produce (log(kg))
 5.814 or about 440 kg of maize.
 This cultivated on (log(acre)) 0.018 or about 1.19 acres on average.
 It also shows that for the average household in the control, maize yields
 (log(kg/acre)) equal 5.850 or about 430 kg/acre.
 Furthermore, in the control group, in 38.7 percent of households at least
 one spouse reported that yields were better than a typical year on at least
 one plot.
 We also look at labour use.
 The average household spent about 72 mandays on maize farming, which includes
 labour that was hired in.
 This translates in a labour productivity of 6.73 kg of maize per hour worked.

In the second column of Table

\end_inset

 we report the impact of the agricultural extension video campaign (with
 corresponding randomization inference based p-values in column 3) for the
 various production related outcomes.
 We see that there is no impact on (log) maize production.
 However, we do see that households that were shown the video produce this
 same amount of maize on an area that is about 10 percent smaller than the
 area used for maize production by households in the control group.
 As a result, we also find that among households that were shown a video,
 yields are about 14 percent higher than among the control group that saw
 a placebo video, and this difference is significant at 5 percent after
 controlling FWER.
 We do not find that households that were shown a video are more inclined
 to feel that yields are better than normal than households in the control
 group.
 With respect to labour, we do not find any effects in the extensive nor
 the intensive margin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results are again consistent with the message that is provided in the video.
 In particular, it is advised that farmers experiment on a small part of
 the field with modern inputs, following recommended practices.
 It is also advised against planting the entire field with eg improved seed
 if this leaves no more money for complementary inputs such as fertilizer.
 Rather, it is suggested that the farmer should combine inputs on a small
 area than to put all eggs in one basket.
 Finally, the video also promotes a more commercial mindset, and pays ample
 attention the the idea of starting small and growing over time through
 re-investing.
 The fact that the video intervention has a clear effect on production related
 outcomes is also reflected in the significant different in the production
 index between treatment and control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Columns 4 and 5 report that additive effect of the invitation to use the
 IVR system on production related outcomes.
 As with previous outcomes, there seems to be little impact from this treatment.
 The only exception is maybe labour productivity, which is about 6.5 percent
 higher among households that received the IVR start kit.
 However, while this difference has an associated p-value of 0.078, it is
 not significant after considering multiple comparisons.
 Similarly, we do not find additional effects on production related outcomes
 of the SMS campaign.
 Also for production related outcomes, we investigate if results are different
 if we restrict to households that have access to a mobile phone (for the
 IVR treatment) and if we restrict to households that own a mobile phone
 (for the SMS treatment).
 Results can be found in Appendix table

The impact on disposal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next investigate if the interventions also have an impact on how households
 dispose of the maize they produce.
 We look at 3 different ways of disposal: maize consumption by the household
 itself, maize sold on the market, and maize saved as seed for the next
 season.
 Results are presented in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:disposal"

\end_inset

.
 The first column in the table shows that, not surprisingly, a large share
 of the households report positive amounts of maize consumed (83.5 percent).
 We also find that a large share of household report that they at least
 sell part of their maize (about 64.3 percent of households).
 This is about twice the market participation rates commonly found in the
 literature, underlining the importance of maize for our study population
 as a source of income 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BARRETT2008299"

\end_inset

.
 We also find that 85 percent of households save maize to be used as seed
 in the next season, illustrating the prevalence of seed recycling and reliance
 on informal seed systems among smallholders

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:disposal"

\end_inset

 reports the impact of the agricultural extension video (with corresponding
 randomization inference based p-values in the third column).
 We find that the proportion of households that reports consuming maize
 is 3.6 percentage points higher among households that was shown a video,
 but the difference is not significantly different from zero.
 We also find that the share of households that reports maize was sold is
 2.3 percentage points higher among households that were shown the video,
 but also here, the effect is not significant.
 Furthermore, we find that the share of households that reported they saved
 maize to be used as seed in the next season is almost 4 percentage points
 lower among households that received the video treatment.
 This is probably because the video underscores the importance of using
 high quality seed, and advises against recycling seed.
 Also here, the difference is not statistically significant.
 However, if we combine the three types of disposal in an index, with maize
 saved as seed entered negatively, we do find that disposal is affected
 by the video treatment.
 The fact that the index is significant but the individual outcomes are
 not is due to the increased efficiency by ensuring that outcomes that are
 highly correlated with each other receive less weight, while outcomes that
 are uncorrelated and thus represent new information receive more weight

The impact on household welfare
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at the impact of the information interventions on measures
 of well-being at the household level.
 Welfare is captured though self-assessment, as well as though consumption
 expenditure.
 We asked these questions to the woman within the household, as we assume
 she has a better idea of consumption expenditure within the household and
 the general level of well-being.
 First, we asked if they feel their household is better off (as opposed
 to equally well off or worse off) in terms of income and consumption than
 the average households in their community.
 We find that among the control group that was shown the placebo video,
 about 39.7 percent of households felt they were better off than average
 (first column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact_welfare"

\end_inset

).
 We find that among the control households, 38.8 percent indicated they were
 better off than six months ago.
 We also include two standard self assessed food security questions taken
 from the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS).
 We asked if households were generally able to eat their preferred food.
  Approximately 41.8 percent of households responded affirmatively.
 We also asked if households were generally able to eat enough food and
 found this to be the case in almost 60 percent of baseline households.

\begin_layout Standard
As a less subjective way to asses changes in well-being, we collected data
 on consumption.
 In particular, we asked the woman in the household about the value of the
 most consumed items, including own-consumption from farm production over
 the period of one week.
 These included consumption of maize, cassava, sorghum, millet, rice, sweet
 potatoes, beans, fruits, groundnuts, vegetables, salt/sugar, cooking oil/ghee,
 soap, and airtime

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Even though these consumption categories were carefully chosen on the basis
 of consumption expenditure data from representative surveys in the area,
 we agree they may not capture everything and the estimates are likely to
 be too low.
 In addition, it may be that the intervention affected the composition of
 consumption, and farmers that had seen the video may have started consuming
 more of a food category that we did not measure, suggesting their consumption
 did not change.
 Care should thus be taken when interpreting this variable.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 From this we then took the logarithm and trimmed at 5 percent.
 We find that log consumption expenditure is about 10.92 in the control group,
 which corresponds to about UGX 65,000 or just under USD 20 per household
 per week.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As in the tables on the impact of other outcome categories, the second and
 third table in Table

 reports average treatment effects for the video intervention.
 We find no evidence of impact on any of the welfare indicators.
 In the next two columns, we report intent to treat effects for the IVR
 intervention.
 Also here, we only find null effects.
 Finally, in columns 6 and 7 we report intent to treat effects for the addition
 of the SMS campaign.
 There is also no effect of the SMS reminders on outcomes.
 We also report conditional effects for subsets of farmers depending on
 mobile phone access/ownership, but also find no effects of the IVR and
 SMS interventions (Appendix Table

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Compliance and Treatment on the Treated Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the IVR and SMS interventions, non-compliance may be a problem.
 For the IVR treatment, compliance was determined by comparing the phone
 numbers extracted from the IVR call log with the phone numbers that were
 given to us by the farmers at baseline.
 We find that only a small number of households that were encouraged to
 use the IVR system also actually called in (8.9 percent or 214 households).
 In addition, we also found that 22 households that did not receive the
 treatment called the IVR system.
 For the SMS reminders, the system reported which households received the
 message.
 Of the 1,113 households that were supposed to receive the reminders, only
 860 or 77.3 percent did.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we therefore also present Local Average Treatment Effects
 (LATE), where the IVR encouragement is used as an instrument for having
 called into the IVR system.
 Similarly, we report two stage least squares results where allocation to
 the SMS treatment is used as an instrument for having received the SMS
 message.
 Note that for the former, due to the potential of two-way non-compliance,
 we need both excludability and monotinicity, while for the latter there
 is only the one-way non-compliance, we only the exclusion restriction is
 needed.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a world characterized by incomplete and asymmetric information, and intra-hou
sehold gender related constraints to efficiency, targeted efforts to fill
 knowledge gaps can make a big difference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "banerjee2011poor,udry1996gender"

\end_inset

.
 However, not every information campaign is equally effective nor inclusive,
 and often, seemingly small attributes, such as the way it is delivered,
 who is targeted by the message and who delivers the message, can result
 in significant differences in impact at the household and intra-household
 level.
 Understanding and quantifying the importance of each of these design attributes
 through rigorous evaluation research should therefore be an essential part
 of any knowledge exchange model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of three complementary ICT-enabled
 agricultural extension approaches (short video messages, IVR, and SMS)
 that can be brought to scale relatively easily and at significantly lower
 cost than alternative modes of agricultural extension.
 In addition, and motivated by the observation that most agricultural extension
 advisory services are biased toward men, we assess the impact of two gender-rel
ated attributes of our ICT-enabled extension approach.
 The first attribute cvaries the gender composition of the person or persons
 that provide the information.
 The second attribute varies the gender composition of the person or persons
 to whom the information is targeted.
 This allows us to test three hypotheses related to (1) the overall effectivenes
s of the information intervention (2) the role of information asymmetries
 within the household; and (3) the effectiveness of cooperative approach
 to farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The various hypotheses are tested using a field experiment where the messenger
 of the information and the recipient of the information is randomly altered
 according to a 3 by 3 factorial design.
 The study population was maize farm households in Eastern Uganda, from
 which we sampled about 3,600 couples.
 These farmers were shown a video according to the treatment group they
 were randomly assigned to.
 The videos showed how improved technologies and practices can be used to
 increase production and introduced.the concept of inter-temporal decision-making
 in farm enterprise management.
 The messages were packaged in an attractive and accessible manner, and
 featured role-model farmers explaining how intensification of maize production
 improved their lives.
 The videos were shown twice, once just before the the planting season,
 and once during planting stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that as a result of being shown the video, farmers have experienced
 improvements in several key knowledge outcomes.
 We do not find incremental effects for the addition of IVR and SMS reminders.
 As a result of being shown the video, farmers also adopted a range of recommend
ed practices: in particular, wefind that farmers reduced their use of DAP
 or NPK and increased their use of urea (and to a lesser extent inorganic
 fertilizer), thereby managing their soils in a more balanced manner.
 Effects are less strong when IVR was added to the video treatment.
 However, there is some evidence that a demand-driven information service
 such as IVR may be more effective to increase the adoption of more complex
 technologies (eg.
 basal application of DAP and the use of hybrid maize seed).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result of having been shown a video, households reduce the area under
 maize cultivation while producing the same amount, leading to a significant
 increase in maize yields, from 428 kg/acre to 488 kg/acre.
 Adding IVR further increases this to 526 kg/acre, but this is driven by
 an increase in production on the same area under cultivation.
 We find no effect from any intervention on self assessed well-being, nor
 on consumption expenditures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is some evidence to suggest that showing video only to the female
 co-head reduces household-level knowledge outcomes as opposed to when the
 information is given to the man only.
 There is also some evidence that targeting the couple instead of only the
 man leads to an increase in the likelihood of using inorganic fertilizer
 and that this fertilizer is also combined with improved seed.
 Comparing male-recipient households to households where the video was shown
 to the couple results in no differences in production-related outcomes
 measured at the household level.
 Changing the messenger attribute does not have any effect on household-level
 outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the video is shown to the couple or the woman in the household (as
 opposed to showing it to only the man), knowledge of the woman increases
 significantly, suggesting information does not flow from the man to the
 woman within the household.
 When the video was shown to couple (as opposed to only the man), women
 are more likely to speak up if they do not agree, and it is more likely
 that an agreement is reached.
 If women also receive the information (alone or as part of the couple),
 men are less likely to make adoption decisions unilaterally.
 If women also receive information, they will make significantly more decisions
 on the use of improved agronomic practices and inputs, but only if this
 information is not also available to the husband.
 Showing the video to both spouses jointly does seem to increase the likelihood
 of joint decision making for some practices, but none is significant after
 correcting for multiple comparisons.
 Finally, on an average plot of one acre, if the video was shown to a woman
 only, the amount produced per acre under male management reduces by 34
 kg and the amount under female management increases by about 26 kg.
 We do not find that it matters if the information in the video was provided
 by a man, a woman, or a man and woman together.

Note: In the first column, means (and standard deviations) in the comparison
 group are presented for each variable.
 Column 2 reports differences between video only and video+ivr (and standard
 error) with its corresponding p-value in column 3 and number of observations
 in column 4; column 5 reports differences between video+ivr and video+ivr+SMS
 (and standard error) with its corresponding p-value in column 6; sample
 size is reported in column 7.
 Reported p-values are based on randomization inference (10,000 permutations);
 ***, ** and * denote that the difference is signficant at the 1, 5 and
 10 percent level, respectively, after correcting for multiple hypothesis
 testing using a family-wise sharp null (10,000 permutations).
 All specifications control for the other orthogonal factors in the factorial
 design.
