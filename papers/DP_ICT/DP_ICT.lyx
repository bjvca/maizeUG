\begin_layout Title
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) to provide agricultural
 advice to smallholder farmers: Experimental evidence from Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Agricultural advisory services generally rely on interpersonal knowledge
 transfers in which agricultural extension agents visit farmers individually
 or in groups to provide information and advice.
 This approach is not always effective and has often proved hard to bring
 to scale, particularly in highly dispersed smallholder farming systems.
 Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been advanced as
 a promising way to overcome these problems associated with information
 delivery.
 We evaluate the effectiveness of an ICT-mediated approach to deliver agricultur
al information in a field experiment conducted among small-scale maize farmers
 in eastern Uganda.
 The approach consists of three complementary technologies: First, we investigat
e the effectiveness of video as a means of delivering information, transferring
 knowledge, increasing technology adoption, increasing productivity, and
 improving well-being.
 Second, we quantify the additional impact of augmenting video with interactive
 voice response (IVR) technology—a more demand-driven approach to information
 provision.
 Third, we estimate the additional effect of time-sensitive short message
 services (SMSs) that remind farmers about key agronomic practices and technolog
ies.
 We find that video is effective in delivering information, with households
 that were shown short videos on how to become a better maize farmer performing
 significantly better on a knowledge test, applying more of the recommended
 practices, and using inputs more effectively than households that did not
 see this video.
 These same households also reported maize yields about 10 percent higher
 than those that did not see the video.
 However, the incremental effects of IVR and SMS technologies were found
 to be limited.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With new possibilities offered by information and communications technology
 (ICT), an abundance of pilot projects and commercial products have entered
 the market with the promise of revitalizing agricultural extension in developin
g countries.
 However, a growing body of evidence suggests that not all ICT-mediated
 extension approaches are equally effective in achieving outcomes such as
 increased knowledge and awareness, higher rates of technology adoption,
 better crop yields, higher farm incomes, or improvements in household welfare.
 This may be because seemingly small design attributes affecting the channels
 through which the information is delivered can significantly influence
 these outcomes.
 This paper investigates the effectiveness of an ICT-mediated extension
 approach designed to provide information about improved maize cultivation
 practices to smallholder farmers in Uganda.
 We consider the specific ICT channel through which the information is delivered
 to the farmer, and differentiate between (i) short audiovisual messages
 viewed on tablet computers that provide detailed information on how to
 improve maize cultivation; (ii) an interactive voice response (IVR) service
 that farmers call into if they need additional information on how to improve
 maize cultivation; and (iii) short message services (SMSs) that remind
 farmers at particular points during the maize growing season about key
 farming practices they should apply, and encourage them to seek more informatio
n through the IVR service.
 The outcomes used to assess the relative effectiveness of these different
 ICT channels include increases in individual-level knowledge about improved
 maize cultivation, and changes in household-level indicators such as the
 use of improved inputs, technologies, and practices.
 We also look at the effect of the three different ICT channels on farm
 production outcomes, maize utilization, and household-level welfare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We draw on a field experiment in which farmers are randomly assigned to
 a group that received a particular combination of ICT-mediated information
 interventions, and are then compared to a group that did not receive that
 particular information intervention 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2016field"

\end_inset

.
 We work with approximately 4,000 farm households sampled from the population
 of households cultivating maize across five districts of eastern Uganda.
 The first intervention takes the form of a short video that explains simple
 yet effective ways to increase maize productivity and profitability, such
 as recommended practices on row spacing and seed rate, the importance of
 quality seed, optimal soil fertility management, and farm budget management.
 To test the overall effectiveness of the information provided through the
 video medium, we compare outcomes of farmers who were shown the informational
 video to outcomes of farmers who were exposed to a placebo video.
 In addition, we provide complementary access to an IVR system to about
 two-thirds of the sampled households who were shown the informational video
 and, within that group, we send about half of the sampled households a
 series of eight follow-up SMS messages at strategic points in time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that providing information to farmers through short videos significantly
 increased their knowledge about modern inputs, improved technologies, and
 recommended practices.
 In addition, farmers who were shown the video were also more likely to
 adopt a range of inputs, technologies, and practices that were promoted
 in the videos.
 We also find clear effects on production, with maize yields 10 percent
 higher than in control households.
 However, these results do not translate into greater well-being.
 We find that the IVR generated no additional impact on knowledge, nor did
 it have a strong influence on technology adoption.
 We only find a positive effect of IVR on the uptake of hybrid seed.
 While the SMS reminders did increase the likelihood that farmers used the
 IVR service, there were no additional effects on other outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
 The next section lays out the main research questions and explains how
 the study fits into the broader literature.
 Section 3 explains the experimental design and corresponding sampling frame.
 Section 4 describes the study site and context, while Section 5 describes
 the interventions used as the treatments in the field experiment.
 We then turn to the results in Section 6 with a discussion of baseline
 characteristics and sample balance.
 This is followed by analysis of the impact of the three technologies tested,
 with subsections for impact on knowledge, practices adopted and inputs
 used, production, utilization, and welfare.
 A final section provides concluding remarks and recommendations for future
 program and research investments in ICT-enabled agricultural extension
 and advisory services.

\begin_layout Section*
Research Aim
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary focus of this study is to test alternative ways in which information
 is provided to farmers through ICT channels to improve the effectiveness
 of agricultural extension services.
 In doing so, we aim to contribute to the literature on how ICTs can increase
 the adoption of modern inputs and improved crop management practices among
 smallholder farmers—a topic that has received considerable attention in
 recent years but has lacked sufficient evidence on which approaches work
 and for whom 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1111/agec.12314,Aker2011"

\end_inset

.
 The role of ICTs in improving access to information on crop management—as
 compared to improving access to market and price information—is a particularly
 challenging topic.
 Information of this kind is often non-excludable and non-rival in nature,
 therefore often under-supplied by the private sector and requiring public
 sector intervention .
 Public sector intervention in this area typically takes the form of information
 campaigns, extension programs, and advisory services, many of which have
 been met with mixed success 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Feder2010,doi:10.1080/13892240903309595,doi:10.1080/13892249985300061,davis2008extension"

\end_inset

.
 These ambiguous outcomes are often associated with specificities of the
 technology, practice, or principle being promoted; the agroecological and
 socioeconomic context in which it is being promoted; and other confounding
 factors that may be poorly understood or too costly to address in program
 design and implementation.
 For example, the fact that many of the potential beneficiaries of an extension
 services live in highly fragmented settlements in remote areas that poorly
 connected by road infrastructure often makes extension approaches such
 as the Training and Visit (T&V) model or Farmer Field School (FFS) model
 too costly
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "bindlish1997impact,feder2006rise,waddington2014farmer"

\end_inset

.
 As a result, ICT solutions for extension such as SMS reminders, purpose-built
 smartphone apps, IVR systems, call-in hotlines, portable tablets and projectors
, and other hardware and software applications have received considerable
 attention in recent years.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several studies have reported positive impacts of ICTs applied to extension
 services.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "RePEc:hbs:wpaper:13-047"

\end_inset

 found that the introduction of a toll-free hotline, through which farmers
 can ask questions to agricultural experts, significantly increased cumin
 and cotton yields among farmers in Gujarat, India.

 found that a multi-media mobile phone-based product linked to expert advisory
 services increased farmers' awareness and knowledge about specific solutions
 to their production constraints in Madhya Pradesh, India.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, on the other hand, found that while mobile phone-based animated videos
 shown to farmers in Burkina Faso induced learning and understanding, it
 was no more effective in encouraging adoption than conventional approaches
 to information provision.
 In Uganda—the site of our study—Grameen Foundation had some success using
 smartphones to provide agriculture-related information to farmers through
 ICT-empowered community knowledge workers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "doi:10.1080/1369118X.2016.1200644"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study compares three technologies, each with their own characteristics.
 In our context, video is an ICT intervention through which information
 is made available to the participating farmer on a limited number of occasions
 (we showed the video only twice) and at moments that are decided upon by
 the provider of the information (we showed the video before the maize planting
 season and early during planting).
 The strength of video is that it can combine audio and visual information
 in an attractive way that is recognizable to the farmer.
 For instance, we use local farmers as it has been found that information
 may be more effective if it is brought by someone one can identify with.
 We hypothesize that the video-mediated approach may be particularly effective
 in disseminating information about new technologies and practices.
 However, we also note that the supply-driven nature of video and the management
 of its use by the information provider rather than the farmer, is a potential
 constraint to its effectiveness.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we consider an IVR service.
 IVR services and hotlines are demand-driven approaches based on the assumption
 that farmers can identify their information needs and are capable of actively
 searching for additional information
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A hotline is a phone number that can be called by a farmer and questions
 can be asked to an expert.
 In an IVR system, a farmer calls a number and navigates through a menu
 to select a topic.
 The farmer then gets to listen to a pre-recorded message.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 One of the main advantages of this approach is that the information is
 supplied in a channel that is continuously accessible to the farmer, and
 can be used on a more timely and relevant basis.
 Such services also tend to be less expensive than video, since an extension
 agent does not necessarily have to physically meet and interact with a
 farmer to transfer information
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In fact, it may also be possible to simply stream video to mobile phones
 of farmers.
 That said, this would likely be more expensive than IVR since more data
 need to be transferred.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Uganda has considerable experience with demand-driven extension: its National
 Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) was build on a consulting business
 model that sought to create a more responsive advisory service 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1111/j.1574-0862.2010.00512.x"

\end_inset

.
 This extension approach may be more effective when farmers' key information
 constraints are associated with unanticipated shocks such pests, disease,
 or adverse weather conditions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:hbs:wpaper:13-047"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we consider SMS reminders.
 SMSs are often framed as a supply-driven behavioral 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nudge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 designed to remind people (with some considerable degree of persistence)
 to make decisions or take actions toward some particular objective.
 Timely reminders have often been found very effective in overcoming inertia,
 procrastination, competing obligations, or simple forgetfulness of human
 beings 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Sunstein2014"

\end_inset

.
 In our context, SMSs are designed to remind farmers on a well-timed recurrent
 basis about important aspects of maize farming.
 However, SMS messages are short and can not be used to provide new and
 complex information: in the present study, they are only used to make the
 information that was provided in the video more salient and to encourage
 farmers to use the IVR.

This study is part of a larger study that also looked at the role of gender
 in video mediated agricultural extension.
 The overall study took the form of a 
\begin_inset Formula $3^{3}$
\end_inset

 factorial design (plus a separate pure control group), where one factor
 corresponds to the technology used and the other two factors varied the
 gender of the person to whom the video was shown within the household and
 the gender of the person who provides the information in the video.
 In this study, we restrict attention to the first factor.
 More information on the overall study can be found in the pre-analysis
 plan, which is pre-registered and publicly available from the American
 Economic Association's registry for randomized controlled trials (AEARCTR-00021

.
 The experiment has four treatment arms, and the IVR and SMS treatments
 are incremental in design.
 The experimental unit is the household.
 A total of 3,703 households were shown a video, while 256 households (our
 control group) were shown a placebo video.
 From those 3,703 households that were shown a video, 2,414 also received
 an IVR starter kit: a flyer containing the IVR number and instructions
 on how to use it.
 From those 2,414 households that were shown a video and received the IVR
 encouragement, 1,113 households were also allocated to the SMS treatment.
 This design, together with the sample size in each treatment category,
 is illustrated in Figure

To evaluate the effectiveness of these different ICT channels, we start
 by comparing average household-level outcomes among households in the control
 group to average outcomes of households that were shown a video.
 Ex ante, we expected the largest effects to be found between the video
 group and the control group and power calculations indicated that we only
 needed about 250 observations in each group to detect such effects
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Power calculations were bases on an elaborate set of comparisons using different
 outcomes to power the complete 
\begin_inset Formula $3^{3}$
\end_inset

 factorial design.
 We used simulation techniques that allowed us to to sample from actual
 data on outcome variables (maize yields obtained from Uganda National Household
 Survey of 2005/06) instead of from a theoretical distribution with an assumed
 mean and standard deviation.
 Apart from the sample size in the control group, sample size in other treatment
 arms are the result of binding constraints for minimal sample size needed
 to test differences in two other factors of the design.
 Detailed information on the power calculations can be found in the pre-analysis.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This gives us the average treatment effect for the video intervention.
 To obtain the additional effect of the IVR treatment, we compare average
 outcomes of households that were shown a video and received the IVR interventio
n to households that were shown only a video.
 Finally, the additional effect of the SMS campaign is estimated by comparing
 outcomes of household that were shown a video, received IVR information
 and also received the eight SMS reminders to outcomes of households that
 are shown a video and received the information about the IVR system, but
 did not get the SMS reminders.

\begin_layout Section*
Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conducted the field experiment among smallholder maize farmers in Uganda.
 Maize is widely consumed throughout much of Uganda, yet its value-to-weight
 ratio is sufficiently high to also make it an important traded commodity.
 Therefore, efforts to increase maize productivity at the farm-household
 level are an important dimension of Uganda's strategy to increase food
 security and reduce poverty through both consumption and income channels.
 Yet, maize yields in Uganda are low when compared to neighbouring countries
 and global averages: While research station trials conducted in Uganda
 report potential yields of about 1.6 metric tons per acre (using only improved
 varieties without fertilizer application), data from the Uganda National
 Household Survey (UNHS) 2005/06 indicate that average maize yields are
 much lower at about 618 kg per acre for the main growing season 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fermont2011estimating"

\end_inset

.
 Moreover, the UNHS data shows considerable variation in productivity across
 farmers, with the top 10 percent of farmers achieving yields in excess
 of 1.1 metric tons per acre.
 At the same time, the use of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer
 and adoption of modern management practices such as row planting is very
 low in Uganda.
 For example, the use of inorganic fertilizer is on average just 2.4 kg of
 nutrient per acre per year, compared to Kenya (75 kg/acre), Rwanda (70
 kg/acre), and Tanzania (15 kg/acre).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maize is especially important in eastern Uganda.
 We sampled from five districts in eastern Uganda known for their maize
 production: Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo, and Namutumba.
 From this, we removed from our sample town councils and also two sub-counties
 that consisted of islands in lake Victoria.
 We used two-stage cluster sampling to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, we first selected parishes randomly and in proportion to
 the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all households, from which we randomly
 assigned households to be included in the study.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In eastern Uganda, there are two maize cropping seasons.
 For our study, we concentrated on the second maize-growing season of the
 year 2017, which ran from approximately August 2017 to January 2018 and
 is characterized by a shorter period of rainfall than the first maize-growing
 season.
 During this second season, the complete cycle from planting to harvest
 requires 3 to 3.5 months, and farmers tend to cultivate early-maturing but
 lower-yielding maize varieties as a result.
 Fields are prepared in August, planted in September, an harvested beginning
 in mid to late December and, at higher elevations, through mid January.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Interventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first intervention used in the study was a video that was shown on 10-inch
 Android tablet computers.
 Videos were screened by a trained field enumerator during a one-to-one
 meeting with either an individual farmer or the male and female co-head
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In particular, the person or persons within the household to whom the video
 was shown was dictated by the other factors in the factorial design, and
 were either the man co-head within the household alone, the woman co-head
 within the household alone, or the man and woman co-heads as a couple together.
 As these factors are orthogonal to the factor corresponding to the ICT-channels
 in the factorial design, it does not matter who within the household the
 video is shown to, and the treatment effect corresponds to the average
 impact at the household level.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The control group received a placebo treatment, which was a music video
 of traditional dancing that contained no information related to farming
 or maize.
 Videos (treatment or placebo) were screened twice to the households in
 the sample, once before the time for planting maize (July 2017) and once
 around planting time (August 2017).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information contained in the treatment groups' video is expected to
 positively influence maize yields by encouraging the adoption of several
 improved technologies and practices which, in turn, are expected to positively
 affect farm-household income.
 The topics included in the video script were obtained from qualitative
 interviews with key informants that were conducted in May 2017.
 The key informants included maize farmers, traders, maize breeders, extension
 workers, district agricultural officers, and other government staff and
 experts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main factors affecting maize productivity that were identified by these
 key informants were related to pests, poor soils, and poor seed quality.
 The three most important pests that affect maize farming are striga (in
 particular the 
\emph on
Striga hermonihica
\emph default
 variety), maize stalk borer (
\emph on
Busseola fusca
\emph default
), and, more recently, fall armyworm (
\emph on
Spodoptera frugiperda
\emph default
).
 We focus on striga management in the videos because it was deemed more
 immediately problematic to our population of interest than maize stalk
 borer, and because, at the time this field experiment was conducted, there
 was no consistent strategy being promoted to address fall armyworm.
 Striga, also called witchweed, is a parasitic plant that feeds off the
 roots of maize, leading to severe stunting of the maize plant.
 Because the nutritional needs of maize are greatest at the early stages
 of growth, weeding of striga becomes less effective in curbing losses as
 the season progresses.
 During the qualitative interviews, experts estimated that striga can reduce
 production from about 30 percent up to total loss of the crop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No single method is effective in controlling striga.
 Progress has been made in developing varieties that are resistant to the
 herbicide imazapyr and can be supplied with a imazapyr seed coating to
 contain striga before it can damage the host plant.
 However, the seeds of this variety on offer in Uganda are expensive at
 10,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) per kg, while seeds of other common or popular
 varieties cost between 6,000 and 8,000 UGX/kg,
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At the time this study was conducted, the official exchange rate was approximate
ly UGX/USD 3,600.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and does poorly under dry conditions and in areas where the rains are short
 such as in eastern Uganda.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the near future, it is expected that the same herbicide-resistance trait
 and seed-coating technology will be released in early-maturing varieties
 such as Longe 10, which are preferred in eastern Uganda.
 See https://striga.aatf-africa.org/.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Crop rotation with sweet potato or beans can also reduce striga infestation,
 as can applications of phosphatic fertilizer to make up for the nutrients
 drained by the parasitic weed.
 Weeding is also a strategy to control striga, and is most effective in
 the weed's earliest growth stages, before it establishes itself on the
 maize plant's root system and before it has a chance to spread via seed
 dispersal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Poor soils, exhausted by continuous cultivation with little rotation, is
 the second main limiting factor.
 Soils often lack macro-nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P)
 and potassium (K), and farmers in our study area rarely use organic or
 inorganic fertilizers in sufficient quantities to ameliorate these deficiencies
, either at the planting stage (when diammonium phosphate (DAP) or nitrogen-phos
phorous-potassium (NPK) applications are recommended), or at the vegetative
 growth stage (when top dressings of nitrogenous fertilizers such as urea
 are recommended).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout eastern Uganda, maize farmers mainly rely on seed saved from
 harvest, which represents the third limiting factor identified by key informant
s.
 The reliance on saved (recycled) seeds tends to negate the significant
 yield advantages conferred by high-yielding maize hybrids, which require
 that fresh seed be purchased at the start of each season to realize the
 genetic gains conferred by heterosis or hybrid vigor.
 And even where farmers rely on recycled seed from improved open-pollinated
 varieties (OPVs) that do not require seasonal replacement, the gains from
 improvement tend to depreciate over three to four seasons, again requiring
 farmers to purchase fresh seed at regular intervals.
 Experts during the qualitative interviews differed in opinions with respect
 to the potential gains from the improved genetic qualities of both maize
 hybrids and OPVs: Yield effects were estimated between 30 and 200 percent,
 depending on climatic conditions and the complementary use of modern inputs
 and intensive management practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, there are also
\series bold
 
\series default
crop management practices that affect yields, but the effects are generally
 smaller than those related to improved varieties, fresh seed, and inorganic
 fertilizer use.
 The most important are timely planting, optimal plant spacing, and timely
 weeding.

\series bold
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Timely planting in eastern Uganda implies that maize should be planted at
 the onset of the rains.
 However, many farmers delay planting for several reasons.
 For instance, they may not be certain that the rainy season has really
 started.
 There may also be bottlenecks in land preparation, where poorer farmers
 are often the last in line for the use of oxen or tractors.
 Experts estimate that for each day a farmer delays planting, yields are
 reduced by 1.5 percent.

\series bold
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optimal plant spacing implies that sowing should be structured so that plants
 are not too close to each other such that they compete for light and nutrients
 which, in turn, reduces yields.
 Plants that are too far from each other means space is wasted, also leading
 to lower yields.
 Related is the number of seeds that farmers plant in each hill.
 Farmers want to be sure of germination and put more than one seed, sometimes
 up to 5.
 If they all germinate, there is competition for nutrients and sun, resulting
 in stunted growth.
 Usually there is also not enough thinning, or this is done too late when
 competition has already occurred.
 One expert told us that standard spacing is 75cm x 60cm with two plants
 per hill.
 However, several experts mentioned a new way of plant spacing of 75cm x
 30cm with a reduced seed rate of 1 seed per hill which leads to a 35 percent
 increase in yields.

Timely weeding implies that the first weeding should be done at 18 to 20
 days after planting, with a second weeding at two to three weeks after
 first weeding.
 From emergence to the

 poor competitor and unwanted stress such as weed competition should be
 prevented.
 A third weeding at the tasseling stage is optional, and depends on observed
 weed pressure after the second weeding.

Note that the videos did not include explicit information on the use of
 chemical pesticides which can be effective in addressing pests but may
 also be hazardous to humans, animals, and the environment.
 The decision to exclude such information was made following a determination
 by the study team that currently available content on pesticide use was
 insufficiently attentive to issues of safe handling, application, storage,
 and disposal of pesticides that are warranted in any study involving human
 research subjects.

 We made sure to include information that is likely to be unknown to the
 farmer, based on findings from other studies that information is most valuable
 when individuals learn about a new technology or institutional innovation

 However, other studies also provide evidence of behavioural change occurring

 Therefore, the videos also contain information that farmers are assumed

However, not all constraints to maize productivity improvement are information
 deficiencies directly related to the use of inputs, technologies, and crop
 management practices.
 Often, missing information problems manifest indirectly, as uncertainty
 about the distribution of the farm-household's profit function.
 This includes uncertainty about the correlations between expected and actual
 returns, the inter-temporality of income streams, estimates of fixed and
 variable costs, hidden transactions costs, probabilities of adverse events,
 and a range of other variables that farmers may simply be unable to conceptuali
ze or measure.
 Thus, a significant portion of the videos also focuses on the costs and
 benefits of the different technologies and practices being promoted.
 In addition, the videos encourage long-term thinking, advising farmers
 to (a) start small and grow their farm enterprise over time, and (b) combine
 technologies and practices together rather than investing all of their
 money and effort into one single input, practice, or technology.
 In short, the videos encourage farmers to experiment with combinations
 of technologies and practices on a small scale in the initial season before
 reinvesting their gains for larger-scale replication in subsequent seasons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also pay attention to how the information is packaged.
 For instance, prior studies have found that farmers find communicators
 who face agricultural conditions and constraints most comparable to their
 own to be the more persuasive than other communicators

As mentioned above, this study focuses on the analysis of only one of three
 factors in a 
\begin_inset Formula $3^{3}$
\end_inset

 factorial design.
 A second factor in the study is related to the person who provides the
 information, differentiating between a singe man, a single woman, or a
 couple (man and woman).
 Therefore, the video intervention actually consisted of three videos that
 are essentially the same except for the fact that the person who provides
 the information varies according to the three factor levels and one of
 these videos was shown to the household.
 As in a factorial design, factors are orthogonal to each other, the likelihood
 that a household gets to see a particular video is the same across the
 three videos, and so we measure the average impact of the three videos.
 The videos can be found

 The farmer-actors talks about how they used to struggle with their maize
 production and how at one point in time, they decided things needed to
 change.
 It is shown how the farmers sell a hen, obtain a small loan from a friend,
 and use these proceeds to buy small quantities of improved seed and fertilizer
 from a local retailer.
 The video then shows how the farmers prepare the field by collecting and
 applying manure.
 Next, the video details how DAP is applied correctly, how maize seed are
 spaced at 75cm x 30cm intervals with 1 plant per hill, and what the correct
 timing of these activities should be.
 The video progresses to a field about 10 to 12 days after sowing when the
 maize has emerged from the soil, and the farmer-actors recommend to engage
 in gap filling to replace seeds that did not germinate, thereby preserving
 optimal plant density.
 The video proceeds to the field at 18 to 20 days after sowing, and the
 farmer-actors recommend how weeding should be conducted with particular
 attention to the identification of striga and the importance of follow-up
 weeding two to three weeks later.
 The video then advances to four weeks after planting, where the farmer-actor
 demonstrates how Urea top dressing is done and recommends one more round
 of weeding at the tasseling stage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The video then turns to a discussion about investing to obtain higher yields
 over time.
 The farmer-actors point out that while it may be difficult to raise cash,
 one can always start small (e.g., on one tenth of an acre) and reinvest the
 returns.
 They explain that following recommended practices and using improved inputs
 led them to produce 2.5 bags of maize on a small plot, which they sold for
 UGX 125,000 with a profit of almost UGX 90,000—as compared to previously
 harvesting merely one bag from the same area at a profit of only UGX 40,000.
 They then explain that they reinvested the difference (UGX 50,000) to increase
 the area under intensive maize cultivation year after year such that, over
 time, they were able to cultivate an entire acre using modern inputs.
 In the final part of the video, they reiterate their experience and again
 encourage the viewer to try a similar approach.

Two other treatments were incrementally added to the video treatment.
 For these two treatments, the IVR system and the SMS reminders, we collaborated
 with Viamo, a social enterprise that aims to connect individuals and organizati
ons using digital technology to make better decisions.
 We set up an IVR system that provided the same information as was recommend
 in the video.
 Farm households that were allocated the IVR treatment could call a toll-free
 number which explained the IVR system in their own language.
 The caller is then invited to select the number corresponding to the topic
 on which he or she wants more information (e.g., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Press 1 for seed selection, 2 for spacing and seed rate, 3 for soil nutrient
 management, 4 for advice on weeding, or 5 for pest management

).
 Depending on what number was selected, the IVR then played an audio message
 of a conversation between two farmers where one farmer is explaining the
 recommended practice to the other farmer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the SMS campaign, we recorded telephone numbers for mobile phones owned
 by the household head at the time of the experiment's rollout.
 Households that were allocated to the SMS treatment were sent eight SMS
 messages over the course of the two months following the first screening
 of the video.
 The messages all followed a similar structure:,farmers were first reminded
 about the important technology or practice that was relevant at the particular
 time that the message was sent, followed by a reminder about the existence
 of the IVR service.
 For example, the first message, that was sent out around planting time,
 read

While we did not conduct a dedicated baseline survey, we did ask questions
 prior to the experiment's rollout to investigate balance.
 The choice of variables was based on those variables that other researchers
 in similar studies used in their orthogonality tests.
 In particular, we looked at balance tables in studies that investigate
 the adoption of yield-improving technologies and practices using randomized

 We collected household characteristics such as household size, age, and,
 education level of household head.
 We then asked more specific questions related to maize farming, such as
 acreage and quantities produced in the last season.
 Furthermore, we asked if the household received agricultural extension
 services, whether it used improved maize varieties, and whether it applied
 fertilizer to maize.
 We also collected data on housing conditions (number of bedrooms) and distance
 to the nearest agro-input shop.
 As mobile phone ownership is relevant to the IVR and SMS interventions,
 we also report balance on household access to and ownership of a mobile
 phone.

, we provide descriptive statistics and balance tests for the comparisons
 between the three information delivery packages.
 Averages for the control group are reported in the first column.
 We observe that few households that were included in our study had access
 to agricultural extension in the previous year (about 11 percent).
 We also observe that only about 17 percent of households reported to have
 used any fertilizer in the previous season, and only about 34 percent reported
 to have used improved seed bought from a shop or agro-input dealer during
 the last cropping season.
 This suggests ample scope to increase intensification investments through
 extension.
 We also find that farmers produced on average only 268 kg of maize per
 acre in the first cropping season of 2017.
 This is substantially lower than the average yield of 618 kg per acre we
 find in data from the 2005/06 Uganda National Household Survey.
 The low yields may reflect the devastating impact of the fall armyworm
 outbreak and adverse weather conditions that plagued East Africa in 2017

Video
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, compares baseline characteristics between households that were shown the
 placebo video (control group) and households that were shown an intervention
 video.
 For example, we see that yields prior to the intervention are about 17
 kg per acre higher in the group that was shown the intervention video than
 in the group that was shown the placebo video.
 However, this difference is not significantly different from zero.
 In fact, for the placebo video versus intervention video comparison, none
 of the differences between baseline characteristics is significant at the
 10 percent significance level, while the F-statistic can not be rejected.
 In the third column, differences in baseline characteristics between households
 that received the intervention video and households that received IVR on
 top of the video are shown (denoted 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

+IVR
\begin_inset Quotes erd

).
 Here, we see that households in the latter group are significantly larger
 than households that only saw the video.
 They also have significantly more bedrooms and the household head is slightly
 older.
 However, we can again not reject the null that jointly, baseline characteristic
s are unrelated to the treatment group for this comparison.
 For the final comparison (comparing farmers that received video and IVR
 to those that additionally received SMS messages; reported in column four
 and denoted 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

), we find that treatment household have slightly fewer bedrooms, but the
 figure is only significant at the 10 percent level and the joint test does
 not reject overall balance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that about 84 percent of households have access to a mobile phone.
 This is encouraging, as the usefulness of IVR depends on access to a mobile
 phone.
 Further, we find that there is no difference in this percentage between
 the various treatment groups.
 The incidence of mobile phone ownership is also high, with about three
 quarters of households reporting they own a mobile phone.
 Again, this is important as the success of the SMS intervention depends
 on being able to receive the messages.

\begin_layout Standard
Following implementation of the field experiment, attrition within the sample
 was relatively low.
 Only 8.63 percent of the sample could not be tracked or persuaded to complete
 the endline survey.
 In addition, there were no indications that attrition rates were different
 between or among the different treatment groups: attrition was 7.03 in the
 control group; 8.74 percent in the group that was shown a video; 8.90 percent
 in the group that was shown a video and received the IVR encouragement;
 and 7.45 percent in the group that also received an SMS in addition to the
 IVR encouragement and the video.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Impact on knowledge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with an elaborate analysis of the intent-to-treat (ITT) effects
 of the ICT channels.
 For the first channel, video, we had virtually no household that refused
 to watch, and so the ITT effect is equivalent to the average treatment
 effect of channel.
 This is not necessarily the case for the two other additional technologies.
 For instance, the IVR treatment consists of an encouragement to use the
 IVR system.
 We cannot ignore the fact that a large proportion of farmers that were
 encouraged to use the IVR ended up not calling the system, as they are
 likely to be a non-random subset of the households that were assigned to
 the IVR treatment, leading to a biased estimate of the IVR channel's impact.
 Also, for the third treatment, the SMS reminders, being allocated the treatment
 does not necessarily mean that the household also receives the SMS message.
 Here again, the probability that a particular household does not receive
 the intended treatment is likely non-random in nature.
 For instance, households that live further away from a mobile phone tower
 may be more likely to experience technical issues leading to delays or
 non-delivery of the SMS message.
 Even though we believe that the ITT analysis is the most informative when
 considering the experiment from a broader policy perspective, we also discuss
 local average treatment effects (LATE) below in an attempt to better estimate
 the effectiveness of the different channels itself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first estimate the ITT effects of the three different ICT channels on
 knowledge outcomes.
 Knowledge outcomes were measured with a short quiz 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "feder2004acquisition,feder2004sending,masset2015does"

\end_inset

 consisting of four multiple-choice questions that were asked during the
 endline survey to each of the two spouses in the farm household separately.
 For each question, three possible answers were read out to the respondent,
 who was then asked to indicate which answer he or she thought was correct.
 The respondent was also allowed to indicate if he or she did not know the
 correct answer.
 The household was considered knowledgeable on a particular topic if at
 least one of the spouses indicated the correct answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first question was related to planting.
 In our video, we recommended a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with 1 plant per
 hill, and this was the correct option.
 Other possible answers included a spacing of 75cm x 60cm with two plants
 per hill, which is standard for many farmers and recommended by many agricultur
al extension agents, and an intermediate alternative of 75cm x 30cm with
 2 seeds per hill.
 Because our video recommended a technique that deviates from what is assumed
 to be standard spacing, we assumed that the recommended practice is new
 to most of the farmers.
 The second question is less related to technical knowledge, but more to
 viewing farming as a business.
 In the video, we paid ample attention to promoting an approach where farmers
 start small and grow over time by reinvesting, and we emphasized the benefits
 of combining inputs rather than investing only in e.g., improved seed.
 We wanted to see if farmers internalize this advice and ask what a successful
 farmer would do if he or she only has 40,000 shillings.
 The correct answer was to use this amount to purchase improved seed and
 fertilizer and start intensified farming on a small area.
 Alternative options were to: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

use all the money to buy hybrid seeds, because without good seeds, yields
 will be low
\begin_inset Quotes erd

; and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

use all the money to buy fertilizer, because with poor soils, yields will
 be low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For the third question, we asked if farmers knew when weeding is most important.
 The video showed that weeding is most important during the first four weeks
 after planting, as maize is a poor competitor for light and nutrients.
 We assumed that most farmers would know the correct answer to this question
 given that weeding is part of well-established management practices in
 the study area.
 Alternative answers were: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

.
 Finally, we asked if farmers knew when spraying against fall armyworm is
 most effective.
 There was no information given about fighting fall armyworm in the intervention
, so unless one of our interventions encouraged farmers to search for additional
 information, we do not expect an impact.
 For this question, the correct option was: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 However, we also see value in examining the impact on the questions individuall
y, as they attempt to measure different aspects of the information intervention.
 To control the family- wise error rate (FWER) when examining scores for
 each question individually, we use re-randomization to construct the joint
 null distribution for the family of outcomes we are testing.
 From this family-wise sharp null, we can obtain the corresponding FWER-consiste
nt significance thresholds by determining which cuttoffs yield e.g., 10 percent-,
 5 percent-, and 1 percent significant hypothesis tests across all tests
 and simulations.

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowh0HH"

\end_inset

 shows results for the three incremental levels of ICT-mediated information
 delivery using different dissemination technologies.
 The first column reports mean scores in the control group (with standard
 deviations reported below in parentheses).
 For the four individual questions, this is simply the proportion of households
 that answered correctly on the particular question.
 For instance, we find that in 16 percent of the households in the control
 group, at least one of the spouses indicated the correct option among the
 response alternatives to the question on optimal maize seed spacing.
 This relatively low rate of correct responses is due to the fact that this
 is a fairly new and potentially controversial recommendation.
 We find that in about 91 percent of households, at least one spouse knew
 inputs were best combined and in more than 95 percent of households it
 was known that weeding is most important during the first 4 weeks.
 In about one third of the households, at least one spouse knew how to fight
 fall armyworm.
 For the knowledge index, the mean is harder to interpret, as it is the
 result of a weighted mean after standardization of the individual components
 of the index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second column, we report the impact of having been shown the video
 (with standard errors of the estimated coefficient reported below in parenthese
s).
 We find that having been shown the video increases the likelihood that
 at least one individual knows the recommended spacing by 13 percentage
 points and this difference is significantly different from zero at the
 1 percent FWER-adjusted significance level (randomization inference-based
 p-value are shown in the third column; asterisks denote significance as
 compared to FWER-adjusted thresholds).
 We also find that the video increased the likelihood that at least one
 spouse indicates that inputs are best combined for optimal results by 4.5
 percentage points.
 This difference is statistically significant at the 5 percent FWER-adjusted
 significance level.
 For the question on weeding, the intervention does not seem to have had
 a significant effect.
 However, this result should be interpreted with care due limited variation
 in the outcome.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In fact, our pre-analysis plan specifies that we would drop from the analysis
 variables where 95 percent of outcomes are the same value.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Finally, on the fall armyworm question, we find that households that were
 shown the video are no more likely than control households to know when
 one should spray to control the pest.
 This suggests that the videos did not encourage farmers to actively search
 information on important challenges that were not explicitly covered in
 the video.
 Overall, and as confirmed by the knowledge index, we conclude that the
 agricultural extension videos increased knowledge at the household level,
 and that this increase seems especially poignant for novel information
 provided in the videos.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fourth column (+IVR) shows the additional (ITT) effect of IVR (with
 standard errors of the estimated coefficient reported below in parentheses,
 and corresponding randomization inference-based p-value in the fifth column),
 on top of the video effect reported in the second column.
 We see that being provided with an IVR encouragement does not additionally
 affect knowledge about the new recommended spacing.
 There is some indication that the IVR treatment reduces the likelihood
 that at least one spouse responded correctly on the question about how
 inputs should be combined, but the reduction is not significantly different
 from zero after taking multiple inference into account.
 Similarly, there is no additional effect on knowledge related to the optimal
 time for weeding and also no additional effect on knowledge about the best
 way to fight fall armyworm.
 The fact that there is no supplementary effect of the IVR encouragement
 on knowledge is confirmed by the non-significant difference in the knowledge
 index.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sixth column (+SMS) reports the additional effect of the SMS reminders
 on the various questions and the index (with randomization inference-based
 p-value are reported in the seventh column).
 Similar to the impact of IVR, we do not find an additional effect of the
 SMS campaign on any of the questions.
 We also do not find an effect of the SMS campaign as judged by the knowledge
 index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be that the null results for both IVR and SMS channels are due to
 the fact that we average over both households that have access to a mobile
 phone and those who do not.
 As the IVR and SMS treatments are likely to be most effective if households
 have access to or own a mobile phone, averaging over all household may
 dilute the effect, making it more difficult to detect a significant difference
 with the control group.
 Therefore, we take a closer look at conditional treatment effects.
 In particular, for the IVR campaign, we re-estimate the impact on knowledge
 again, but only for the 3,002 households that reported to have access to
 a mobile phone (either because someone within the household owns a mobile
 phone or because they can use the phone of a neighbor or relative if necessary).
 For the SMS reminders, access to a mobile phone is likely not sufficient.
 To get the most benefit from the SMS reminders, households need to own
 a mobile phone.
 We therefor reran the analysis for the subset of 2,736 farm households
 that reported owning a mobile phone.
 However, results (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowh0HH-1"

\end_inset

) are very similar to the results obtained from the analysis on the entire
 sample, with no additional effects from neither IVR nor SMS reminders on
 knowledge outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, especially for the IVR encouragement, the analysis above estimates
 the effectiveness of the intervention in increasing knowledge, adoption,
 and production outcomes.
 It does not provide an estimate of the efficacy of the IVR treatment itself.
 To get to the effect of the IVR system itself, we need to consider compliance:
 did farmers also use the IVR system? For the IVR treatment, compliance
 was measured by comparing the phone numbers extracted from the IVR call
 log with the phone numbers that were given to us by the farmers at baseline.
 We find that only a small number of households that were encouraged to
 use the IVR system also actually called in (8.9 percent or 214 households)
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is a very low compliance rate, which partly reflects low demand for
 the service.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:hbs:wpaper:13-047"

\end_inset

 find that for a similar service in India, compliance rates were as high
 as 88 percent.
 Among possible explanations for this difference are: the time frame (the
 88 percent was measured after 2 years of intensive exposure to the system,
 compliance rates were much lower at midline; our IVR system was only 3
 months operational); differences in treatment intensity (we only sent 8
 reminders while 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:hbs:wpaper:13-047"

\end_inset

 sent bi-weekly reminders); the different study population of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:hbs:wpaper:13-047"

\end_inset

, that consisted of cotton farmers that expressed willingness to participate
 and owned a mobile phone; different technologies (hotline where direct
 questions can be asked to real person extension agents vs IVR that works
 with pre-recorded messages and a limited set of options).
 However, there are also signs that our indicator of compliance may under-report
 true compliance (because for instance encouraged farmers use different
 phones to call the hotline).
 This is illustrated by the fact that about 430 unique calls were made to
 the hotline, representing about 18 percent of encouraged households.
 Unfortunately, we did not enquirer if farmers called the hotline during
 endline data collection.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In addition, we also found that 22 households that did not receive the
 encouragement called the IVR system.
 Compliance was also imperfect for the SMS treatment.
 For the SMS reminders, the system reported which households received the
 message.
 Of the 1,113 households that were supposed to receive the reminders, only
 860 (77.3 percent) did.
 We therefore also generate LATE estimates , where the IVR encouragement
 is used as an instrument for having called into the IVR system.
 Similarly, we report two stage least squares results where allocation to
 the SMS treatment is used as an instrument for having received the SMS
 message.
 Note that for the former, due to the potential for two-way non-compliance,
 we need both excludability and monotonicity, while for the latter, there
 is only one-way non-compliance, hence only the exclusion restriction is
 needed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowLATE"

\end_inset

 we repeat the average scores for the control group in the first column
 for reference purposes.
 In the second and third columns, we report results of a two stage least
 squares (2SLS) regression where the endogenous variable, an indicator that
 takes the value of one if the household called the IVR, is instrumented
 by the IVR treatment allocation.
 We conclude that, based on the LATE estimates, calling the IVR system on
 top of having seen the intervention video did not affect knowledge outcomes.
 In the fourth and fifth columns, we report LATE estimates for the SMS reminders
 as results of a 2SLS regression where the endogenous variable, an indicator
 that takes the value of one if the household received at least one SMS
 message, is instrumented by the SMS treatment allocation.
 As for the ITT effect, we also find no additional effect of receiving SMS
 on top of the intervention video and invitation to the IVR as evaluated
 by LATE estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There may be different reasons why we do not find additional knowledge effects
 of the IVR encouragement and the SMS reminders.
 First, the lack of additional effects may be due to the way the experiment
 was designed.
 As we wanted to rule out any possibility that the effects were driven by
 differences in the content, we made sure that no new information was given
 in the IVR system and in the SMS campaign.
 In fact, we were interested in testing if IVR is effective in mitigating
 the fact that video is a one-off intervention and farmers may forget the
 details related to new and complex agronomic practices.
 Also for the SMS campaign, the messages are too concise to transfer new
 knowledge.
 The aim here was to simply remind farmers that the moment was there to
 implement what they learned in the video, and encourage them to call the
 hotline.
 In light of this, it may be less surprising that we do not find additional
 knowledge effects from the two interventions.
 The null result for the IVR treatment on knowledge is also consistent with
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:hbs:wpaper:13-047"

\end_inset

, who also do not observe differences between the treatment and control
 groups in agricultural knowledge outcomes from a hotline in either their
 midline or endline survey data.
 They argue that this was, to some extent, to be expected: as a demand-driven
 service, the types of knowledge that respondents gain reflect their actual
 demand for information.
 Also in our case, we did not test knowledge on the topics that were chosen
 most frequently by the farmers that used the IVR system (pests, diseases,
 land preparation, and seed selection)
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We did test knowledge related to the fall armyworm pest.
 However, the IVR system did not include information on this.

 The results are also consistent with results from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 the farmers do not already know the information that is contained in them.

Adoption effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We continue our analysis by examining the effect of our incremental treatments
 on household-level adoption of recommended farming practices.
 During the endline survey, we collected detailed information on practices
 employed on the household's maize plots.
 Results of mean adoption rates in the control group for different practices
 are reported in the first column of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_h1_ag"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, in the video, we recommend to start planting maize immediately
 after the start of the rains.
 We find that 37 percent of households in the control group reported that
 they started planting one day after the start of the rains on at least
 on plot–a relatively high rate of adoption for this practice that indicates
 the extent to which it is likely known among farmers.
 We also find that only 2.6 percent of households in the control group used
 the recommended way of plant spacing of 75cm x 30cm with a reduced seed
 rate of 1 seed per hill.
 This low rate in the control group is not surprising given that this was
 a new and somewhat controversial recommendation.
 Almost 69 percent of control households report removing striga before it
 flowered to reduce damage early on and prevent the weed from spreading.
 Finally, we find that about 43 percent of control households reported first
 weeding after 18-20 days as recommended in the video.

The second column in Table

 again reports the difference in the adoption of practices between households
 that were shown the intervention video and households that were give the
 placebo treatment (with standard error of the estimate in parenthesis below
 and corresponding randomization inference-based p-values in column 3).
 We find that for the first recommended practice, early planting, there
 is no impact from the video treatment.
 However, the likelihood that households adopt the recommended 75cm x 30cm
 spacing with a reduced seeding rate increases significantly after having
 been shown the video: while only 2.6 percent of households in the control
 group report adopting this practice on at least one plot, this figure increases
 to 8.9 percent among households that were shown a video (and this difference
 is significant at the 1 percent FWER-corrected significance level).
 Similarly, we find that the proportion of households that removed striga
 early on increased from 68.5 percent to 74.7 percent as a result of being
 shown a video (randomization inference-based p-value of 0.020, significant
 at the 10 percent FWER-corrected significance level).
 Finally, while the proportion of households that reported having started
 weeding after 18-20 days is almost 2 percentage points higher among households
 that were shown the video, the difference is not significantly different
 from zero.
 Estimation results for the index that summarizes the different practices
 confirms that overall, we can conclude that the videos significantly increased
 the adoption of recommended practices.
 Results suggest this is particularly the case if it concerns practices
 that are new and less likely to be known by farmers.

 We do not find any significant additional effect of the IVR treatment on

 The sixth and seventh column report results for the additional effect of

 While we do find that the proportion of households that reports to be removing

 group, and while we also find a small positive effect on seed spacing and
 seeding rate, the differences are not significant.
 The fact that the both the IVR encouragement and the SMS campaign has no
 impact on adoption of practices is also reflected in the index estimation
 results.

Similar to the analysis for knowledge outcomes, we repeat the analysis to
 assess the sensitivity of the results to potential treatment heterogeneity
 related to mobile phone access.
 In particular, we redo the analysis for the additional effect of the IVR

 mobile phone.
 Results are reported in columns 2-4 in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In addition, we repeat the analysis for the additional impact of the SMS

 Results for this are in columns 5-7 of Appendix Table

 Results are very similar to those reported in Table

 is not driven by treatment heterogeneity with respect to mobile phone access
 or ownership.
 In Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

, we account for non-compliance in the IVR and SMS treatments when looking
 at adoption.
 As in Table

\end_inset

, we use 2SLS and instrument callers with the IVR encouragement and recipients
 of at least one SMS message with treatment allocation to the SMS reminder

 For the efficacy of both treatments on agronomic practices, there is no
 impact.

Next, we examine results related to the use of modern inputs.

 Results are reported in Table

 The first column in Table

 We find that 26.4 percent of control households report that they used DAP

 widespread with only 5.1 percent of control households reporting urea use
 on at least one plot.
 Among control households, 15.7 percent reported using organic fertilizer

The impact of showing videos on fertilizer use is reported in column 2 and
 3 of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

.
 We see that the video treatment reduced the use of DAP or NPK by 4.7 percentage
 points.
 This difference has an associated randomization inference-based p-value
 of 0.088.
 However, it is not significant after controlling FWER.
 We find the opposite result for urea use with estimates indicating an increase
 of almost 5 percentage points (with a randomization inference-based p-value
 of 0.011, and significance at the 5 percent level after controlling FWER).
 We also find that the use of organic fertilizer increased by about 50 percent
 as a result of the video treatment.
 Summarizing the three types of fertilizer in a index results in a positive
 difference between treatment and control, with the difference significant
 at the 10 percent level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The opposing effects of the video on different types of fertilizer, the
 inorganic types in particular, may be due to the fact that in the video,
 we pay particular attention the benefits of combining inputs and technologies.
 The video may thus encourage farmers to reassess their mix of fertilizers,
 reducing the use of fertilizer types that are already used widely and increasin
g the use of fertilizer types that are less commonly used.
 In the light of this reasoning, the fertilizer index may need to be specified
 differently, as more is not necessarily better for each type of fertilizer.
 Specifically, and in the light of the imbalance in the control group, one
 may argue that DAP/NPK use is higher than optimal and urea use is lower
 than optimal.
 As such, a case can be made to include DAP/NPK use in the index with a
 negative sign.
 Doing so, we conclude that the video intervention has a significant effect
 on the fertilizer mix used by farmers (with a randomization inference-based
 p-value < 0.001).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The incremental impact of the IVR encouragement is reported in columns 4
 and 5 of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

.
 While the difference between treatment and control is positive for both
 types of inorganic fertilizer, the effects are not significant.
 However, we do find that the IVR encouragement reduced the proportion of
 households that reported using organic fertilizer by about 25 percent.
 This negative impact may again be explained by a change in the mix of fertilize
r.
 In the context of a more demand-driven ICT channel, farmers that used organic
 fertilizer may seek information on more efficient types of fertilizers.
 If we judge the effectiveness of the IVR encouragement by including organic
 fertilizer use in the index with a negative sign, we do indeed find a significa
nt impact (with a randomization inference-based p-value = 0.009).
 The additive effect of the SMS campaign is reported in columns 6 and 7
 of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

.
 We find that the SMS reminders reduced the likelihood of using urea and
 increased the likelihood of using organic fertilizer, although none of
 the differences is significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the lower panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

, we report results for the use of improved seed.
 We differentiate between maize hybrids and open-pollinated maize varieties.
 In the first column, we see that use of improved seed is more common than
 fertilizer use: in the control group, about 30 percent of households report
 using open-pollinated varieties on at least on plot, and this percentage
 is only slightly lower for hybrids.
 We do not find that the video treatment changes these percentages (columns
 2 and 3).
 However, we do find an effect from the IVR encouragement: the percentage
 of households that reported to have used hybrid seed on a least one plot
 was 4 percentage points higher in the treatment group.
 Apparently, providing farmers with a tool that allows them to actively
 seek out information about a new input or technology increases the likelihood
 that they also adopt it.
 The impact of the IVR treatment on improved seed use is confirmed by the
 seed index.
 The addition of SMS reminders, on the other hand, does seem to reduce the
 likelihood that hybrid maize seed is used (columns 6 and 7).
 However, the effect ceases to be significantly different from zero after
 controlling FWER.
 The additional effect of the SMS campaign on the seed index is also insignifica
nt.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We again investigate robustness of the results for the IVR and SMS interventions
 by rerunning the analysis conditional on mobile phone ownership.
 The results from this analysis are presented in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_CATE"

\end_inset

.
 We find that for the subset of households that have access to a mobile
 phone, the IVR encouragement still reduces the likelihood of using organic
 fertilizer and increases the use of DAP/NPK (but not urea).
 If we include organic fertilizer use with a negative sign in the index,
 we still conclude that the IVR treatment significantly affects fertilizer
 allocation (with a randomization inference-based p-value = 0.006).
 The addition of SMS reminders reduces urea use more in the subgroup of
 phone owners (with a randomization inference-based p-value=0.050), but the
 estimate is not significantly different from zero after controlling FWER.
 We also find that organic fertilizer use is slightly higher among households
 that were allocated to the SMS treatment.
 Based on estimates of the fertilizer index, there is also no additional
 effect of SMS on fertilizer use.
 The additional effect of the IVR treatment on seed use becomes insignificant
 if we restrict ourselves to the subset of farmers that have access to a
 mobile phone, while the negative effect of the SMS campaign on hybrid seed
 use now becomes significant at the 10 percent FWER-controlled significance
 level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results for the LATE estimates for inputs are somewhat more interesting
 than LATE estimates for agronomic practices (see Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_LATE"

\end_inset

): We find a substantial reduction in the use of organic fertilizer if farmers
 make use of the IVR system.
 We also find a significant effect of having received at least one SMS message.
 The effect of the SMS reminder reverses the IVR effect somewhat, but the
 effect size is very low.
 Further, we find that farmers that called the IVR line are much more likely
 to use hybrid seed.
 Also here, the effect is reversed by the SMS treatment.

Production effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now turn to the intervention's effects on production-related outcomes.
 We first examine household-level maize production.
 During the endline survey, we asked both spouses separately to estimate
 how much maize was harvested from each plot.
 These quantities were then summed over the different maize plots assessed
 by each spouse and the average between the two spouses was taken as the
 final estimate of household-level maize production.
 We find that overall, a typical household in our sample produced about
 500 kg of maize on an average of 1.16 acres, with yields estimated at 530
 kg per acre.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:yield_ag_allh"

\end_inset

 shows mean values for the production indicators for the control group.
 On average, control households produce (log(kg)) 5.814 or about 440 kg of
 maize.
 This was cultivated on (log(acre)) 0.018 or about 1.19 acres on average.
 It also shows that for the average household in the control, maize yields
 (log(kg/acre)) equal 5.850 or about 430 kg/acre.This is much higher than
 yields recorded at baseline (290 kg/acre) for the previous season, possibly
 because rainfall patterns were better during our intervention and farmers
 may have given greater attention to combating fall armyworm.
 Still, compared to figures recorded in FAOSTAT (1000 kg/acre) or figures
 from household survey data (typically around 600 kg/acre), yields were
 below what might be considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in Uganda.
 This is also confirmed by the fact that in less than 40 percent of households
 at least one spouse reported that yields were better than a typical year
 on at least one plot.
 We also look at labour use.
 The average household spent about 72 person-days on maize farming, which
 includes labour that was hired in.
 This translates in a labour productivity of 6.73 kg of maize per hour worked.

In the second column of Table

\end_inset

 we report the impact of the video treatment (with corresponding randomization
 inference-based p-values in column 3) for the various production related
 outcomes.
 We see that there is no impact on (log) maize production.
 However, we do see that households in the video treatment produced this
 same amount of maize on an area that is about 9.6 percent smaller than the
 area used for maize production by control households.
 As a result, we also find that among households in the video treatment,
 yields are about 10.3 percent higher than among the control group, and this
 difference is significant at 10 percent after controlling for FWER.
 The fact that the video intervention has a clear effect on production-related
 outcomes is also reflected in the significant different in the production
 index between treatment and control.
 That said, we do not find that households in the video treatment were more
 inclined to feel that yields are better than normal than control households.
 and with respect to labour, we do not find any effects at the extensive
 or intensive margins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results are again consistent with the content provided in the video.
 In particular, the video advised that farmers experiment on a small part
 of their field with modern inputs, following recommended practices, and
 advised against using improved seed on their entire field if this does
 not leave sufficient money for complementary inputs such as fertilizer.
 Further, the video advised farmers to pursue a more commercial mindset
 to maize cultivation, and paid ample attention to the idea of starting
 small and growing over time through re-investing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Columns 4 and 5 report the additive effect of the IVR treatment on production-re
lated outcomes.
 As with previous outcomes, there seems to be little impact from this treatment.
 The only exception is with respect to labour productivity, which is about
 6.4 percent higher among households that received the IVR starter kit.
 However, while this difference has an associated p-value of 0.070, it is
 not significant after after controlling FWER.
 Similarly, we do not find additional effects on production related outcomes
 of the SMS campaign.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we investigate if production-related outcomes differ if we restrict
 our sample to those households that have access to a mobile phone (for

Impact on maize utilization 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next investigate if the intervention also have an impact on how households
 utilize the maize they produce.
 We look at three different ways that harvested maize can be used: for consumpti
on by the household itself, for sale in local markets, or as seed saved
 for sowing in the next season.
 Results are presented in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:disposal"

\end_inset

.
 The first column in the table shows that, not surprisingly, a large share
 of the households in the control group report positive amounts of maize
 production retained for consumed (83.5 percent).
 We also find a large share of household reporting that they sell part of
 their maize (64.3 percent of households).
 This is about twice the market participation rates commonly found in the
 literature, underlining the importance of maize for our study population
 as a source of income 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BARRETT2008299"

\end_inset

.
 We also find that 85 percent of households save maize for use as seed in
 the next season, illustrating the prevalence of seed recycling and reliance
 on informal seed systems among smallholders 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:disposal"

\end_inset

 reports the impact of the video treatment (with corresponding randomization
 inference-based p-values in the third column).
 The video treatment's effect on the proportion of households reporting
 to have consumed maize is not significantly different from zero; neither
 is the effect on the proportion of households reporting have sold maize.
 However, the share of households that reported having saved maize for seed
 is 3.3 percentage points lower lower among households that received the
 video treatment, although the difference is not statistically significant.
 Despite this, the sign on the coefficient estimate here is consistent with
 the video's content that emphasizes the importance of using high quality
 seed and advises against recycling seed.
 When we combine the three types of utilization in an index, with maize
 seed saving entered negatively, we do find that utilization is affected
 by the video treatment (albeit only at a 10 percent significance level).
 The fact that the index is significant but the individual outcomes are
 not is due to the increased efficiency by ensuring that outcomes that are
 highly correlated with each other receive less weight, while outcomes that
 are uncorrelated, and thus represent new information, receive more weight

In the fourth and fifth column, we report the additional effect of the IVR
 encouragement.
 There are no additional effects of the IVR on home consumption, nor on
 the likelihood that households sell part of their maize production.
 We do find among households in the IVR treatment that the proportion that
 saved maize as seed for the next season was lower by an additional 2.4 percentag
e points.
 However, with a randomization inference-based p-value of 0.113, this difference
 is not significant.
 The index also confirms that we can not reject the null of no additional
 effect from the IVR treatment.
 In the sixth and seventh column, results are presented for the additional
 ITT effect of the SMS reminders.
 We do not find any additional effect on maize utilization outcomes.

Impacts on household welfare

Finally, we examine the impact of the ICT interventions on measures of well-bein
g at the household level.
 Welfare is captured though self-assessment and through consumption expenditure.
 We asked welfare-related questions to the main adult woman decision-maker
 within the household, as we assume she has a good idea of both consumption
 expenditure within the household and the general level of well-being.
 First, we asked if they feel that their household is better off (as opposed
 to equally well off or worse off) in terms of income and consumption than
 the average household in their community and relative to six months earlier.
 We find that among control households, 39.7 percent felt they were better
 off than the average household in their community and 38.8 percent felt
 they were better off than six months ago (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 We also include two standard self-assessed food security questions taken
 from the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The first asks whether the household was generally able to eat its preferred
 food, and 41.8 percent of households responded affirmatively.
 The second asks whether the household is generally able to eat enough food,
 and 60 percent of households responded affirmatively.

As a less subjective way to asses changes in well-being, we collected data
 on consumption.
 In particular, we asked the adult woman decision-maker in the household
 about the value of the most-consumed items in the household, including
 household own-consumption of farm production, over the period of one week.
 These questions included consumption of maize, cassava, sorghum, millet,
 rice, sweet potatoes, beans, fruits, groundnuts, vegetables, salt/sugar,
 cooking oil/ghee, soap, and airtime

Even though these consumption categories were carefully chosen on the basis
 of consumption expenditure data from representative surveys in the area,
 we agree they may not capture everything and the estimates are likely to
 be too low.
 In addition, it may be that the intervention affected the composition of
 consumption, and farmers that had seen the video may have started consuming
 more of a food category that we did not measure, suggesting their consumption
 did not change.
 Care should thus be taken when interpreting this variable.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 From this we then took the logarithm and trimmed at 5 percent.
 We find that log consumption expenditure is about 10.92 in the control group,
 which corresponds to about UGX 65,000 or just under USD 20 per household
 per week.

Impact of SMS campaign on IVR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the SMS treatment does not appear to have any effect on many of
 the outcomes discussed above, it is worth exploring whether the treatment
 had an effect on the use of the IVR encouragement.
 Recall that an important aim of the SMS treatment was to remind farmers
 that they can call the IVR system to get additional information on the
 practices they were being reminded about: each message ended with the instructi
on to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 To this end, Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:call"

\end_inset

 shows that the SMS messages did seem to encourage participants to use the
 IVR.
 Restricting our attention to households that received the IVR encouragement,
 we see that among households that received the IVR encouragement 
\emph on
but were not allocated to the SMS treatment,
\emph default
 only 6.5 percent actually called the IVR line (column 1).
 This percentage was 6.1 percentage points higher among households that received
 the IVR encouragement and were also allocated to the SMS treatment (column
 2 and 3).
 If we use SMS allocation to the treatment as an instrument for actually
 receiving the SMS messages (columns 4 and 5), the effect increases to 8.1
 percentage points.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of three complementary ICT-mediate
d agricultural extension approaches that can be brought to scale relatively
 easily when compared to many of the more conventional extension approaches
 in use among smallholder farmers today.
 The first approach–the use of short, appealing video messages animated
 by farmer-actors who farmers can relate to–is probably the approach containing
 the most substantial quantity of relevant information.
 While appealing because of its combination of both audio and visual information
, the approach is also somewhat supply-driven, assigning farmers to a passive
 role as the recipient of information.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 The second approach–an interactive voice Response (IVR) service–allows
 the farmer to play a more active role in information acquisition by allowing
 the farmer to call into a system that offers menu-based choices leading
 to pre-recorded message.
 The third approach–a series of SMS messages that reminds the farmer of
 particular key inputs or practices–provide a nudge to farmers that makes
 available information more salient or encourages them to seek out additional
 information, and has been shown to be effective in a variety of other contexts

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We test the relative effectiveness of these three ICT channels using a field
 experiment that involved nearly 4,000 smallholder maize farmers in eastern
 Uganda.
 To assess the effectiveness of the first channel,we compared outcomes of
 a random subset of farmers that was shown an informational video to a random
 subset of farmers that was shown a placebo video.
 From this initial treatment group, two-thirds of the farmers that were
 shown the video were randomly assigned to receive an IVR starter kit which
 encouraged them call into the IVR service to obtain information on maize
 cultivation that was consistent with the video's content.
 From this second treatment group, half were randomly assigned to receive
 a series of eight time-sensitive SMS reminders related to the recommended
 practices and technologies, along with a reminder to use the IVR service
 to obtain additional information.
 The design of this experiment allowed us to estimate the effect of the
 video treatment as well as the additional effects of the IVR encouragement
 and SMS treatments.
 Effectiveness was measured in terms of knowledge gained, practices and
 technologies adopted, production increased, utilization affected, and welfare
 improved.
 By taking into account non-compliance to being offered the services, we
 could estimate the additional treatment on the treated effects.
 We also considered treatment effects conditional on access to and ownership
 of a mobile phone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Findings indicate that in our study site and context, video-enabled agricultural
 extension approaches affect a range of outcomes.
 Showing agricultural information videos to maize farmers increased knowledge
 outcomes, particularly on new practices and technologies, and increased
 the adoption of recommended practices, particularly those that were new
 and otherwise unknown to farmers.
 Videos also led to adjustments toward more balanced fertilizer use, with
 farmers increasing the use of certain types of fertilizers (urea and organic)
 and reducing the use of others (DAP, NPK).
 As a result, farmers that were shown agricultural information videos increased
 their maize yields by 10 percent

.
 These results are thus the result from increases on the intensive, not
 extensive, margin.
 However, we did not find an impact on several measures of household well-being.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The IVR treatment offered in addition to the video treatment did not seem
 to additionally increase knowledge or adoption outcomes, although there
 is some evidence to suggest that farmers who received the IVR encouragement
 were more likely to use hybrid maize seed.
 We found no additional effect of being offered IVR on production, utilization,
 nor well-being.
 The SMS reminders provided in addition to the video treatment and IVR encourage
ment also did not have any additional effect.
 The results (or lack thereof) for the IVR and SMS treatments are robust
 to incorporating non-compliance and persist if effects are estimated conditiona
l on mobile phone access and ownership.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One area that needs further attention is related to spillovers.
 It is well known that experimental studies of information treatments are
 especially prone to non-interference violations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "coppock2014information"

\end_inset

.
 As such, our estimates are likely to underestimate the true effects of
 ICT-mediated extension approaches.
 On the other hand, there is considerable evidence that much of the learning
 among smallholders happens through peer learning 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bandiera2006social,conley2010learning"

 Some studies have tried to understand how peer learning can be leveraged
 to accelerate agricultural technology adoption and diffusion

.
 The question then becomes which ICT-mediated extension approach maximizes
 spillover effects, for instance through ease of sharing of content.
 Future studies should be designed with such questions in mind, by for example
 ensuring exogenous variation in treatment saturation or by using a “multilevel”
 design where different levels correspond to different spillover networks
 and treatments are assigned so as to create variation in different levels

 in column 4; column 5 reports differences between video+ivr and video+ivr+SMS
 (and standard error) with its corresponding p-value in column 6; sample
 size is reported in column 7.
 Reported p-values are based on randomization inference (10,000 permutations);
 ** and * denote that the difference is signficant at the 5 and 10 percent
 level, respectively, after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing using
 a family-wise sharp null (10,000 permutations).

Note: In the first column, means (and standard deviations) in the control
 group are presented for each variable.
 Column 2 reports differences between video only and video+ivr (and standard
 error) with its corresponding p-value in column 3 and number of observations
 in column 4; column 5 reports differences between video+ivr and video+ivr+SMS
 (and standard error) with its corresponding p-value in column 6; sample
 size is reported in column 7.
 Reported p-values are based on randomization inference (10,000 permutations).
 All specifications control for the other orthogonal factors in the factorial
 design.
