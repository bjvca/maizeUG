Appropriation, Shirking and Hiding: Spousal Disagreement among Ugandan Maize
 farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To gain a better understanding of intra-household bargaining processes,
 surveys increasingly collect data from co-heads individually.
 Answers provided by spouses on the same set of questions often differ substanti
ally, and while this is partly due to measurement error, there is also some
 signal in the noise.
 Some studies argue that cultural context may lead to systematic bias that
 may be due to a different meaning attached to concepts being elicited.
 Others suggest that at least part of the disagreement originates from spouses
 strategically hiding information from each other.
 Using detailed data on a large sample of monogamous smallholder maize farming
 households in eastern Uganda, we document patterns in spousal disagreement
 in reporting related to decision making, labour time and sales.
 We also implement two  interventions to test if we can reduce disagreement
 by increasing cooperation between spouses and reducing information asymmetries.

 The focus on intra-household decision-making processes has also substantially
 increased the availability of data that is collected at the individual
 household member level, especially from the co-heads of the households.
 Studies that collect data from male and female co-heads separately find
 that spouses often provide different answers on even the most basic questions

 some extent, spouses exploit these information asymmetries by deliberately
 hiding assets and decisions from each other.

\begin_layout Standard
We contribute to this line of research by documenting spousal disagreement
 in reported behaviour among a large sample of semi-subsistance maize farming
 households in Uganda.
 First, on a range of decisions that are crucial to increase maize yields
 such as timely planting, seed spacing, and weeding, we ask both spouses
 separately to indicate who made each of these decisions on each plot of
 the household farm.
 Spouses can indicate they took the decision alone, that their spouse took
 the decision alone, or that the decision was taken jointly.
 These answers are then combined to assess the extent and direction of disagreem
ent with respect to decision making.
 Second, we ask each spouse separately how much time he or she spent on
 five different important maize farming related activities (land preparation,
 planting, weeding, spraying, and harvesting) on each plot.
 We also ask each co-head to provide an estimate of how much time his or
 her spouse spent on these same activities.
 We similarly combine these answers to assess the extent and direction of
 disagreement with respect to labour time allocation.
 Finally, we ask each co-head how much maize was sold jointly with his or
 her spouse, and how much maize he or she sold unilaterally (as opposed
 to joint sales).
 We also ask each co-head to provide an estimate of how much his or her
 spouses sold by him/herself.
 These answers are again combined to assess the extent and direction of
 disagreement with respect to maize marketing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An additional contribution of our study consists of testing the impact of
 two interventions on spousal disagreement.
 Inspired by recent research on behavioral change communication and social
 marketing, the first intervention consists of a treatment that promotes
 a mental model of maize farming as a joint venture, with both spouses having
 an equal role in decision making, activities, and rewards.
 The second intervention aims to reduce information asymmetry with regard
 to good maize farming practices between spouses.
 By making sure both spouses have similar information about eg.
 what decision need to be made, what labour is required, and what yields
 can be expected, spouses are expected to be better able to monitor each
 other and provide better estimates of each other's efforts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find substantial disagreement between spouses.
 For instance, we find that co-heads exaggerate their own decision making
 power on almost one in four plots.
 We find that the intervention where we promote cooperation using a couple
 role model reduces the likelihood that co-heads overestimate own influence
 on decision making.
 We find similar effects from reducing information asymmetry between spouses.
 For labour, we find that spouses seem to relatively overstate their own
 labour and understate their spouses labour.
 However, we also find a substantial part of the sample where a co-head
 reports to work less than what the other thinks.
 We find that, to some extent, the likelihood that spouses overstate own
 labour contributions reduces as a result of providing spouses with information
 that allows them to better monitor each other.
 Finally, for marketing, spouses tend to overstate own sales.
 Promoting cooperation within the household reduced the likelihood and degree
 of one spouse reporting lower sales than what the other spouse assumed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The next section gives
 a brief overview of the literature on spousal disagreement.
 We then present the experimental design and explain the rationale underlying
 the intervention.
 Next is a brief section describing the context and the characteristics
 of the households in our sample.
 We then turn to the results, first looking at the extent and direction
 of spousal disagreement about decision making, followed by an assessment
 of the impact of the two interventions on spousal overstated and understated
 disagreement about decision making.
 This is followed by a section on spousal disagreement on labour time allocation
 and the impact of the interventions, and a section on extent and direction
 of spousal disagreement about maize marketing and impact of the interventions.
 The findings are then used to reflect on some of the mechanisms that have
 been proposed to explain patterns of spousal disagreement.
 A final section concludes.

\begin_layout Section
Literature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we review related literature.
 We mainly focus on the empirical literature on intra-household resource
 allocation and decision-making in rural development contexts that uses
 observational data from surveys in which both spouses are interviewed separatel
y and are asked the same set of questions.
 Such studies are often interested in learning about women's empowerment
 and autonomy.
 For example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1728-4465.2002.00299.x"

\end_inset

 asks both spouses questions on the locus of decision making on a variety
 of issues, as well as specific questions concerning women's mobility and
 access to resources.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"

\end_inset

 collect data from both spouses on a range of autonomy items, including
 the need of the wife to obtain the husband's permission to go to a range
 of places, the wife's capacity to decide on children's affairs, if the
 wife is allowed to have a job, her role in deciding on the number of children
 and some household expenditure related decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common finding in studies that ask the same set of questions to different
 individuals within the household is substantial disagreement between spouses,
 even on questions that would seem straightforward to verify objectively
 such as the number of children or type of material used for house construction.
 This may indicate that part of this divergence is simply due to measurement
 error.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"

\end_inset

 suggests that disagreement is also partly due the fact that the response
 categories do not have the same cognitive or semantic meanings to men and
 women, leading to the somewhat pessimistic conclusion that survey questions
 are of limited utility for understanding differences in gender stratification
 across context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "SEYMOUR201897"

\end_inset

, the primary focus is on testing if sole decision making correlates differently
 to a measure of autonomy than joint decision making.
 However, they note that spouses often give inconsistent answers when asked
 about who made a particular decision.
 This leads them to check if female sole decision making is equally empowering
 if the male co-head disagrees that the women took the decision alone than
 when spouses agree.
 They conclude that disagreement may signal underlying power dynamics within
 the household that are likely to be relevant when assessing individual
 level agency and empowerment.

 may be problematic for interventions seeking to use survey data to develop
 and inform strategies for reducing gender inequalities or empowering women

\end_layout

One particularly insightful study that tries to separate signal from noise
 is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 They develop a conceptual model that differentiates between three explanations
 for spousal disagreement.
 First, they note that if disagreement solely derives from measurement error,
 disagreement should be symmetric, and the female co-head's responses should
 not differ systematically from the male co-head's responses.
 Secondly, they test for asymmetric measurement error, where men and women
 interpret questions differently.
 In this case, answers may differ systematically between spouses, but disagreeme
nt should be similar for the different questions asked in the survey.
 Finally, they argue that finding differing rates of disagreement across
 survey questions, and higher disagreement for assets and activities that
 are easier to hide in particular, points to asymmetric information.
 Using observational data on decision making and asset ownership in Bangladesh,
 they find that asymmetric information in the form of hidden assets and
 decisions is present in the households.
 However, we feel that information asymmetry does not always have to be
 the result of one spouse intentionally deceiving another.
 There may be other systematic biases that manifest more in one asset or
 decision category than others that may be shaped by prevailing gender roles
 and norms.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that, in a careful case study in northern Uganda, men often report
 unilateral decision making in areas where they are assumed to bear final
 responsibility, even if women had some degree of involvement.
 Women tend to view these scenarios as joint decisions.
 As such, it is important to understand the local cultural context to differenti
ate between information asymmetry stemming from intentional hiding and other
 gender related systematic bias and disagreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 is another powerful illustration of the conceptual and analytical value
 of intra-household contention over decision-making.
 The primary contribution of that paper is that it does not simply consider
 disagreement as a binary variable, but argues that the direction of the
 disagreement may also be important for assessing agency and empowerment.
 More in particular, they differentiate cases in which men disagree that
 women are involved in decision making from cases where men disagree that
 women are not involved in decision making.
 The former is interpreted as women

taking power

, while in the second case women are said to be

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While most studies focus on disagreement with respect to decision making,
 diverging questions on asset ownership are also very common.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "twyman2015gendered"

\end_inset

 document gender differences in perceptions about land ownership in Ecuador.
 Assets, including savings and income, are also easier to quantify than
 decision making.
 As such, instead of simply recording if an asset is owned by a spouse using
 a yes/no question, some studies go further and try to put amounts on this.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "castilla2012ties"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 uses the husband's own reporting of his own farm income and compares this
 to the wifeâ€™s reporting of the husband's farm income to identify income
 hiding by men.
 She finds that women's estimate of farm income is on average 28 thousand
 Cedis lower than what men report, representing 14 per cent of household
 income.
 In Malawi, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "FISHER2010966"

\end_inset

 finds that in 66 per cent of households in their sample, the husband understate
d his wifeâ€™s income by an average of 47 per cent of what the wife reports.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the above studies are descriptive in nature, exploring patterns
 in agreement and disagreement in spousal decision making, asset ownership
 and income.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 differently with important outcomes for households, women, and children.

 observe association with intra-household information asymmetry and power
 dynamics.
 The emerging consensus is that spousal disagreement indicates intra-household
 dynamics with impact on important outcomes.
 Therefore, we agree with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANNAN2021105292"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that more research is needed to understand which interventions can change
 spousal disagreement and the intra-household dynamics that drive it.
 Therefore, in the next section, we describe two interventions designed
 to change intra-household dynamics and disagreement among spouses.

\begin_layout Standard
The emerging literature on spousal disagreement suggests at least two underlying
 mechanisms.
 First, to some extent, spousal disagreement may reflect different cognitive
 understanding of the responses categories and what the appropriate response
 should be 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This problem is compounded by the cultural context in which these questions
 are asked and answered 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A first treatment therefore attempts to challenge pre-conceived ideas of
 what decision making of a spouse involves and who is expected to make decisions
 in a farm household by promoting a cooperative approach to maize farming,
 in which maize growing activities is seen as a joint responsibility.
 Second, the literature also establishes that spousal disagreement reflects
 information asymmetry between spouses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A second intervention tests if this informational asymmetry can be influenced
 by giving spouses equal ex-ante knowledge on best practices in maize farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the heart of both interventions is a short video that is shown twice
 to individuals within households using tablet computers.
 The aim of the video was to increase knowledge of the viewer with respect
 to best practices in maize farming, such as timely planting, row planting,
 and the use of improved inputs such hybrid seed and inorganic fertilizer.
 It does this through an aspirational story where a farmer (or farmers)
 recount how he/she/they used to be poor but managed to increase yields
 over time by applying a set of techniques and inputs.
 It also encourages farmers to view maize growing as a business that needs
 investment to develop over time and includes some simple inter-temporal
 cost-benefit calculations to illustrate this.
 Viewers are encouraged to follow the example of the model farmer(s) in
 the video.
 The first intervention consists of an adapted casting for the video and
 the second intervention of a variation on who within the household the
 video was shown to.
 These variations and the rationale behind them are explained below.

Within households, individual members often have differing spheres of influence
 reflecting prevailing gender roles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 In agricultural households, women often have a stronger voice in the cultivatio
n of food security crops such as cassava or sweet potato and other crops
 that are predominately grown for home consumption.
 Men usually focus more on crops that are also marketed.
 Gendered differences in crop choices may emerge from a variety of factors,
 including gender related differences in knowledge about the crop, access
 to planting material, and customs and traditions

 it is not always easy to capture in data, as gender is only one of the

\begin_layout Standard
In Uganda, maize, which is in a part a cash crop, is considered to be mostly
 in the influence sphere of men.
 Generally, men will make all important decisions such as on what plots
 to plant maize, how to prepare the land, when to start planting and what
 seeds to use.
 Men also generally decide on how much labour is needed, and women assist
 men, often with weeding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We expect that such a separation in spheres of influence between male and
 female co-heads contributes to spousal disagreement.
 Therefore, we devised an intervention consisting of an adaptation of the
 video featuring male and female actor-farmer role models to promote a worldview
 where both spouses participate equally in maize farming.
 Recent research has shown that role models may be important to increase
 women participation in otherwise male dominated sectors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 One way in which large groups of people can be exposed to role models is
 through engaging media content

 In the context of smallholder agriculture,

 find that exposure to video that show aspirational life stories of successful
 farmers affected both viewersâ€™ investment in their childrenâ€™s education
 and other future-oriented behaviors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test the hypothesis that spouses disagree less if they view farming as
 a joint spousal activity, we randomly selected 261 households from our
 sample and showed them (male and female co-heads together) a version of
 the video where a couple is depicted.
 This group functions as the treatment group.
 In another random sample of 240 households, the control group, we showed
 exactly the same video (again to male and female co-heads together), except
 for the fact that it only featured a single male actor-farmer.
 As the only difference between the two videos was the fact that in one
 video a couple was shown and in the other a single male actor appeared
 , any difference in outcomes between the two groups should be attributed
 to a couple role model effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Information asymmetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Smallholder agricultural households consist of different individuals, each
 with their own preferences, skills and access to assets.
 At the same time, individuals also need to invest in common goods for the
 survival of both the household as a unit and its members.
 In households, there are also various shared assets and resources from
 which individual household members draw.
 As such, households can be considered as informal institutions, and many
 of the problems encountered in common pool resource management and collective
 action, such as free-riding and over-extraction of resources also apply
 within the household 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doss2015collective"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way in which collective action problems can be attenuated is through
 increased mutual monitoring.
 For instance, if one co-head can better assess the actual time that the
 other co-head worked on preparing the field, the latter is expected to
 be less likely to engage in labour shirking.
 Or, if it becomes easier to check how much each co-head earned through
 the sale of maize, instances of income hiding can be expected to decrease.
 However, in order for mutual monitoring to work, co-heads need to have
 a good idea of what to compare against, as merely observing an outcome
 may be insufficient to determine if a co-head cheated.
 For instance, it may be difficult for the female co-head to check if her
 spouse over-reports time spent preparing the field if she does not have
 a good understanding of what land preparation entails.
 If both spouses have a good understanding of what agricultural management
 entails, they are also in a better position to monitor each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a second treatment, we therefore make sure both co-heads start off with
 symmetric information with respect to best agronomic practices for maize
 farming, as this facilitates mutual monitoring.
 To do so, we show the video that showcases best practices in maize farming
 to both spouses in a random sample of 261 households.

The study involved a random sample of maize farmers in eastern Uganda, an
 area that is know for its maize production.
 Two-stage cluster sampling was used to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, from five districts (Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo,
 and Namutumba), we first selected 50 parishes randomly and in proportion
 to the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all the households, and in each village
 we sampled 10 households to be included in the study.
 This resulted in a total sample size of 3,280 households.
 However, in an about 23 percent of the households, we were unable to interview
 both spouses separately, resulting in an effective sample of 2,548 households.

\begin_layout Standard
We focus on the second maize growing season of 2017, which runs from about
 August 2017 when fields are prepared, to January 2018 when maize is harvested.
 Treatments were administered twice, once in August 2017 when farmers were
 preparing fields and one month later during planting time.
 Concurrent with the first treatment administration in 2017, we also collected
 some information on household characteristics and on the previous harvest,
 which was the first harvesting season of 2017.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmers in our study area cultivated on average about 1.5 plots of maize.
 Yields during the first season of 2017 were extremely low (about 270 kilograms
 per acre) as a result of the Fall Armyworm invasion.
 The baseline data also shows that the average household head is 40 years
 old and about 60 per cent did not finish primary education.
 The average household consists of almost 8 individuals.
 Only 11 per cent of households report that they had access to agricultural
 extension in the year prior to the survey.
 Only 17 per cent used fertilizer on at least one plot, and 34 per cent
 reported to be using hybrid maize seed or an open pollinated variety.
 About three quarters reported that the household owned a mobile phone.

We now turn to an in depth analysis of the data that was collected at endline.
 The focus is on spousal disagreement using own and cross-reporting (that
 is, what one spouse thinks the other spouse would report).
 We start by looking at patterns in decision making about a series of important
 maize cultivation practices.
 We then turn to time use, again disaggregated over a set of important tasks
 in maize cultivation.
 Finally, we look at decisions related to maize marketing.
 Under each heading, we provide a detailed descriptive analysis of disagreement
 based on the entire sample of 2,548 households, and then report on the
 findings from the two treatment in the respective sub-samples.

\begin_layout Standard
We start by exploring patterns of decision making related to maize growing
 within the household.
 We asked the head of the household to list all maize plots that the household
 was cultivating during the season preceding the survey, which was the second
 agricultural season of 2017.
 We then cycle through the different plots and repeat a series of questions
 for each plot.
 The same questions were asked separately to each co-head.
 We asked, for a range of key decisions that need to be made and that are
 known to significantly affect maize yields, who made the decision on that
 particular plot.
 Respondents could answer that decisions were made by the person that was
 interviewed alone; by the spouse of the person interviewed alone; by the
 person interviewed and his or her spouse jointly; by someone else inside
 or outside the household; by the person interviewed together with someone
 else inside or outside the household; or by the spouse of the person interview
 jointly with someone else inside or outside the household.
 Respondents could also indicate that they did not know who made the decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by looking at the responses given by the male co-heads within the
 household (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:decision_male_reporting"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The first decision we consider was simply who decided that maize should
 be planted on the particular plot.
 A second decision is related to timing of planting.
 Timely planting of maize is very important for subsequent maize yields.
 Maize planting should start immediately after the first rains of the season,
 resulting in significant time pressure when large areas need to be planted.
 A third important decision that maize farmers have to make is related to
 the spacing of seed and seed rate.
 There is a wide range of seed methods used by farmers.
 Some simply broadcast the seeds.
 However, row planting leads to significantly higher yields as plants have
 optimal space to obtain sufficient sun and nutrients.
 Farmers also often plant more than one seed per hill, because they fear
 some seeds may not germinate.
 However, planting more than one seed per hill may also increase competition
 for light and nutrients, leading to stunted growth.
 It is therefore recommended to use only one seed per hill and engage in
 gap filling when seeds do not germinate after one week.
 We also asked who made decisions related to weed control.
 For weeding, we differentiate between decision making related to strategies
 used to combat striga infestation (a parasitic weed that feeds off the
 roots of the maize plant) and weeding more general.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:decision_male_reporting"

\end_inset

 shows that, at least according to the male co-head, joint decision making
 is the norm.
 For example, on the 3,723 maize plots on which data was collected, men
 indicate that on 1,947 plots the decision to start planting maize was taken
 together with the wife.
 This corresponds to about 52 percent of plots.
 The pattern seems to be rather consistent across the different decision
 spheres.
 For the decision on how to fight striga, the percentage drops to 42 percent,
 but this is due to the fact that on some plots striga was not a problem
 and so no decision needed to be made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure also shows that on one out of three plots, the male co-head states
 that decisions are made by him alone, without consulting his wife.
 Also here, the percentages remain stable across the decision makings spheres,
 with a slightly higher incidence of male co-head unilateral decision making
 on spacing and slightly less unilateral male decision making on weeding.
 Finally, the figure also shows that, according to men, women decide to
 plant maize without consulting their husband on 414 out of the total 3,723
 plots, corresponding to about 11 percent.
 This share is also stable over the five decision spheres considered in
 the figure, with slightly more decisions taken by women on weeding and
 slight less on seed spacing.

, but now shows responses as provided by the female co-head.
 Also here, we see that women report that decisions are generally made jointly:
 on the 3,723 maize plots in the sample, the woman co-head indicates that
 on 1,892 plots the decision to start planting maize was taken by the male
 and female co-head together.
 Also for the other decisions, on about half of all plots women say the
 decision was made jointly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Women also report that it is more common that men take decisions alone than
 that women take decisions alone.
 For instance, women report that on 1,015 out of the 3,723 maize plots,
 man took the decision to start planting without consulting anyone else.
 However, there is less consistency over the different decision spheres.
 Men are relatively less likely to unilaterally decide on weeding related
 activities.
 Finally, women report that they make decisions unilaterally on about 15
 percent of the plots.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 suggest some degree of disagreement between spouses.
 For instance, while male co-heads indicated that they alone took the decision
 to plant maize on about 32 percent of the plots, women say that man unilaterall
y took the decision to plant maize on only 27 percent of the plots.
 At the same time, female co-heads say they alone decided to plant maize
 on 16 percent of the plots.
 Men indicate that women unilaterally decided to plant maize on only 11
 percent of the plots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate this disagreement further, we construct measures based on
 answers of both spouses.
 As there are a large number of potential response combinations, it is customary
 to collapse responses into a few meaningful categories to reduce noise
 and facilitate analysis.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 define a variable for cases where the wife says that she is involved (alone
 or jointly as part of the couple), but the husband says she is not, and
 a variable for cases where the husband says the wife is involved but she
 reports that she is not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANNAN2021105292"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and differentiate disagreement by the relative locus of decision making
 and define plots on which co-heads over- or understate their own role in
 decision making.
 Cases where co-heads place most weight on the self as the locus of decision
 making, and so tend to overstate their own roles, are indicated in the
 dark shaded area at the right of the agreement diagonal in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Agreement-matrix"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 These are instances where one co-head claims that decisions are made by
 him or her alone, but the spouse disagrees and claims that she or he took
 the decision alone or was at least involved in it.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Agreement-matrix"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that for the decision to plant maize on the plot, following this
 definition, co-heads overstate their own role in decision on 23.3 percent
 of the plots in our sample: on 5.3 percent of plots the male or female co-head
 says he or she made the decision to plant maize but the other disagrees
 and claims it is her or him who decided unilaterally; on 5.9 percent of
 plots the male co-head says he was involved in the decision but the female
 co-head says she took the decision alone; and on 12.1 percent of plots the
 female co-head says she was involved in the decision but the male co-head
 says he took the decision alone.
 Overstating thus means that at least one spouse says he or she took the
 decision alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We further define instances where co-heads understate their own role in
 decision making and the locus of decision making is placed in the other.
 These are cases in the light shaded area to the left of the diagonal in
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 least involved in the decision.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows that for the decision to plant maize on the plot, following this
 definition, co-heads under-report their own decision power on 17.6 percent
 of the plots in our sample: on 2.7 percent of plots the male or female co-head
 says the other co-head made the decision to plant maize but the other co-head
 disagrees; on 4.0 percent of plots the male co-head says his spouse took
 the decision alone but the wife says he was involved; and in 10.9 percent
 of the cases the female co-head says the husband took the decision to plant
 maize unilaterally, but the husband disagrees and claims his wife was involved.
 Understating thus means that at least one spouse says that the other spouse
 took the decision alone.

 The Figure further shows that spouses are more likely to exaggerate their
 role in decision making than to understate their contribution.
 Especially for weeding (and related striga weeding) the locus of decision
 making inclines to the self.

 The second column shows the average treatment effect of the first treatment
 and reveals that there is no effect of the couple role treatment on the
 likelihood that spouses overstate their won role in the decision to plant
 maize on plot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The comparison between those who saw the couple video and those who saw
 a video with a single actor is repeated for all five decision spheres.
 We find significant reductions in the likelihood that co-head overstate
 own influence as a result of the couple role model intervention for the
 decisions on when to start planting and on weeding.
 For the timing on planting, we see that among households where the video
 featuring only a male farmer was shown, co-heads overstate their involvement
 in this decision on 22.5 percent of plots.
 In households that were exposed to the couple role model video, the share
 of plots where co-heads overstate their involvement in this decision is
 only 16.9 percent.
 For the decision related to weeding, we see that in the control group,
 overstatement of own influence affects 25.6 percent of the plots, but this
 happens on only 19.3 percent of the plots in the group that was exposed
 to the couple role model video treatment.
 Average treatment effect estimates for all other decision categories are
 also negative, but not significantly different from zero.

\begin_layout Standard
In the third column, we report control group means for the share of plots
 on which spouses understate own decision making power.
 We see that in the control group the decision to plant maize is affected
 by this type of disagreement on 13.7 percent of the plots.
 The fourth column shows the difference in this type of disagreement between
 households that received the couple role model treatment and those who
 did not.
 Overall, we do not find that the treatment reduced the likelihood that
 spouses understate own decision making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next turn to the second treatment and compare disagreement on decision
 making between co-heads in households where only one co-head viewed the
 video and households where the video was shown to both co-heads.
 Column 5 of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:decisions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 show that in households where only one of the co-heads was exposed to the
 video, spouses overstate their own influence on the decision to plant maize
 on the plot on 23.5 percent of the plots.
 Column 6 indicates that this percentage was 5.0 percentage points lower
 among households where both spouses were shown the video, and this reduction
 is statistically different from zero at the 5 percent significance level.
 We also find that on decisions related to the timing of planting and weeding,
 making sure spouses start off with the same information leads to a reduction
 in the likelihood that one spouse assigns him or herself more decision
 power than the other spouse claims.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the last two columns, we look at the impact of providing both spouses
 with the same information on the likelihood that one spouse gives too much
 credit to the other spouse.
 Control group means, shown in column 7, are again close to what we find
 in the entire sample depicted in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The last column shows that the likelihood that spouses understate their
 own contribution reduces as a result of providing both spouses with the
 same information, but the effect is never significant.
 Overall, we conclude that both treatment are effective in reducing the
 likelihood that spouses overstate their own role in decision making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Labour time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also collected detailed information on labour time.
 On each maize plot, we ask each co-head how much time, expressed in labour
 days, he or she worked on a particular activity.
 We also ask each co-head to give an estimate of how much time his or her
 spouse worked on the plot on that particular task.
 The activities we inquired about are land preparation, planting, weeding,
 spraying and harvesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-spent-man"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 shows time spent on different activities as reported by the male co-head.
 We see that the male co-head spends about 8 days preparing the plot, 2
 days planting, almost 15 days weeding, one day spraying, and another 2
 days harvesting.
 The figure also shows that the male co-head reports that his wife spends
 one day less in preparing the land and also half a day less in weeding.
 Men think women almost never engage in spraying of insecticides, herbicides
 or fungicides.
 The average male co-head in our sample thus reports to work about 28 days
 on the average plot over the entire agricultural season.
 He reports that his wife works about 26 days on that plot over the entire
 season.

, but now as reported by the female co-head within the household.
 Interestingly, while male co-heads think they spent more time on all activities
, female co-heads are also of the opinion that they work harder than their
 spouse on all activities, the only exception being spraying.
 Female co-heads claim they work on average about 7 to 8 days on field preparati
on, while they think the male co-head only works 6 days on field preparation.
 Female co-heads also indicate that they spend 16.5 days on weeding, while
 they report that their spouse spent only 13.5 days on that activity.
 According to women, male and female co-heads spend about the same time
 on planting and harvesting.
 Only for spraying, co-heads agree that the male co-head provides most of
 the work.
 According to the female co-head, she works almost 30 days, while the male
 co-head works about 25 days over the entire season.

\end_inset

 again suggests substantial disagreement between spouses on time worked.
 For instance, we see that male co-heads report that they work on average
 about 8 days to prepare the land, yet women indicate that men only work
 6 days to prepare the land.
 Women on the other hand report that they work on average 16 days on the
 field to weed, while men think that women only work 14 days on the field
 for weeding.
 And while on average spouses seem to relatively overstate their own labour
 and understate their spouses labour, there is also a substantial part of
 the sample where a co-head reports to work less than what the other thinks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the analysis, we thus define measures of spousal over- and understatement
 of labour time similar to what we did for decision making in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Decision-making"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 To do so, we compare own reported time of the spouse to the time that was
 estimated by the other spouse.
 For each activity, we thus sum the time that the male co-head reported
 he spent on that activity and the time that the female co-head reported
 she spent on the activity and compare this to the time that the male co-head
 estimated that his wife spent on this activity plus the time that the female
 co-head estimated her husband spent on the activity.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While we could also look at over- and understatement of labour time for
 the male co-head and the female co-head separately, we decided to aggregate
 these measures at.
 This is because we are mainly interested in (reducing) disagreement as
 opposed to eg (increasing) women empowerment.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Based om this, we define 2 categories (and associated indicator variables
 of the categories): i) plots on which spouses overestimate own labour contribut
ions, and ii) plots on which spouses underestimate own labour contributions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Shirking"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that on more than half of the plots, spouses overstate the labour
 that was allocated to land preparation.
 At the same time, we also find that on 30 percent of the plots, spouses
 indicate that they actually spent less time on land preparation than his
 or her spouse thinks.
 This means that only on about 15 percent of the plots, spouses agree on
 the time spent on the activity.
 The figure also shows that, while spouses overstate labour contributions
 more frequently than they understate labour contributions, there is substantial
 difference depending on the activity.
 For instance, with respect to spraying, these seems to be agreement on
 almost 60 percent of the plots.
 Higher levels of agreement on planting, spraying and harvesting are partly
 explained by the fact that less hours are reported (see Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-spent-man"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-spent-woman"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) and so there is less scope for difference in cross reporting.
 For spaying in particular, many households report not spaying and so both
 spouses report zero hours and know their spouse also spent zero hours.
 However, this is only part of the explanation as disagreement on land preparati
on is similar to disagreement on weeding despite the fact that about twice
 the amount of labour was allocated to weeding than what was allocated to
 land preparation.
 The gap between over and understatement of labour is also larges for land
 preparation.

Table

 reports on the impact of the role model intervention (left panel) and the
 intervention aimed at increasing information symmetry (right panel) on
 the likelihood that spouses overstate and understate own labour efforts,
 disaggregated by the different tasks.
 We see for instant that in the control group of households that got to
 see the video where a male actor is providing all the information, on about
 52 percent of the plots spouses indicate that they spent more time on preparing
 the plot than the other co-head thinks he or she did.
 This is again in line with what is reported in Figure

.
 
\end_layout

The second column reveals that the couple role model intervention did not
 affect the rate at which spouses overstate own labour contribution to land
 preparation.
 In fact, we do not find an effect of this intervention on any type of labour.
 The third column shows control group means for the rate at which spouses
 understate own labour contribution, again consistent with Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In the fourth column, we report treatment effects for the couple role model
 intervention on the likelihood that spouses underestimate own contributions.
 The intervention also did not affect this outcome.

, we show again control group average rates of overstatement of spousal
 labour contributions.
 In the control group for the treatment aimed at reducing information asymmetry,
 spouses overstate own labour contributions on almost 60 percent of the
 plots.
 However, as shown in column six, this percentage is 8.6 percentage points
 lower among couples that both got to see the video, and this difference
 is significant at the 5 percent level.
 We also find that reducing information asymmetry reduces the likelihood
 that spouses overstate own labour contributed to harvesting.

Finally, in the seventh and eighth column, we report control group means
 and average treatment effects on the propensity to under-report own labour
 contribution as a result of reducing information asymmetry.
 Here effect are mixed, with significant increases in the likelihood that
 spouses overstate labour allocated to land preparation and weeding, but
 a significant reduction in the likelihood that spouses understate own labour
 allocated to spraying.

Finally, we look at decisions regarding maize marketing.
 We asked each spouse separately how much maize was sold from the season

 much was sold by (1) him or her alone, (2) by his or her spouse alone,
 and (3) jointly

Overall, just as in the case of decision making related to maize cultivation,
 most maize marketing happens jointly as a couple.

 Women reported that they think the male co-head only sold 0.25 bags of maize.
 Women, on the other hand, report that they sold only about 12 kilograms

 Men think that the female co-head unilaterally sold about 6 kilograms.
 As such, in percentage terms, quantities hidden is similar between male

 average from their unilateral sales of maize.
 Women estimate this revenue to be only about 2 dollar.
 Finally, women report that they received 1.5 dollar from unilateral sales.
 Male co-heads estimate that the female co-head got on average 60 cents
 from what she sold alone.
 Note that the difference between spouses' own reporting and cross reports
 increases when moving from quantities to revenues, indicating not only
 disagreement with respect to quantities sold but also with respect to prices
 obtained.
 For male co-head unilateral sales in particular, men seem to assume significant
ly higher sales prices than women do.

As in previous sections, we look at the impact of the two interventions
 on disagreement related to maize sales.
 Also for sales, while on average spouses tend to overstate own sales, there
 are instances where spouses report to have sold less than what the other
 co-head thinks.
 We thus construct indicators of spousal over- and understatement of sales.
 As was the case for labour, we will not differentiate between female co-head
 and male co-head over- or under-reporting of sales, but create an aggregate
 measure that evaluates the difference between male and female co-heads
 own reported sales and what the other co-head thinks he or she sold.
 We conjecture that encouraging cooperation through the use of a couple
 as role models and reducing information asymmetries between spouses may
 lead to a reduction in income hiding.

Results are in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The three rows in the table correspond to three different outcomes that
 reflect disagreement in market participation.
 The first is a simple binary indicator that takes the value of one if spouses
 indicate they sell more (less) than what the other spouse thinks.
 The second considers actual quantity overstated (understated) by spouses.
 In the third row, we consider disagreement in value reported derived from
 these sales, as we have seen in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Maize-sales"
plural "false"
caps "false"

 that there may be disagreement about prices received for maize sold in

In the first column of the first row, we see that in the control group for
 the couple role model treatment, in 15 percent of households, spouses report
 that they sold more than what the other spouse think.
 The likelihood that spouses overstate is similar in the treatment group.
 We also find that, as reported in the second row, average quantities over-repor
ted is about half a bag.
 The second column finds no evidence of significant couple role model effect
 as judged by the coefficient estimate of the treatment indicator using
 tobit model.
 We also find no impact of the couple role model treatment on over-reporting
 of revenue (third row column two).

, we see that in 12 percent of households, spouses under-report own sales
 relate to what the other co-head says.
 In the fourth column, we see that the couple role model intervention decreases
 this type of disagreement by almost 6 percentage points.
 The role model effect is also reflected in a reduction in understatement
 of actual quantities: in households where the video was shown to both spouses,
 the quantities under-stated reduced by almost 1.5 bags.
 While the third row also shows a reduction in the value associates with
 the effect, the effect is not statistically different from zero.

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Above we have documented substantial spousal disagreement in decision making,
 labour contribution and marketing.
 We further found that the likelihood that spouses overstate their own role
 in decision making can be reduced by reducing information asymmetry and
 to a lesser extent by promoting cooperation within the household through
 a role model intervention.
 Results were less clear for over- and understatement of labour contributions,
 but results are more encouraging for the treatment that attempts to provide
 spouses equal access to information.
 For marketing, promoting cooperation within the household reduced the likelihoo
d and degree of one spouse reporting lower sales than what the other spouse
 assumed.
 In light of this, we now reflect on some of the mechanisms that have been
 proposed to explain patterns of spousal disagreement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With respect to differences in reporting related to decision making, in
 societies with strong gender norms and customs, spouses may overstate their
 own role in decision making due to role congruity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 It may also indicate that spouses claim a larger role within the household,
 in effect claiming recognition for responsibilities taken 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ANNAN2021105292"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The case of spouses understating their own role in decision making may
 also be consistent with a range of possible explanations.
 On the one hand, cultural factors may again mean that one spouse plays
 down his or her role and discounts own contribution.
 At the other extreme, one could even imagine situations where the locus
 of decision making is shifted to the other, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

blaming
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 poor decision making on the other spouse (for example when ex-post the
 decision turned out to be a very bad decision).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results from our intervention suggests that cultural factors play an
 important role in disagreement related to decision making.
 The intervention that promotes a cooperative approach to role models is
 expected to challenge traditional views in the region that men are assumed
 to take responsibility for maize growing.
 At the same time, the fact that we also find significant effects from arming
 both spouses with equal information may mean that increased monitoring
 reduced the likelihood that spouses take decision behind each other's back.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For labour, cultural factors may also result in one spouse claiming to do
 the bulk of the work, while in reality work burden is shared.
 However, it may also indicate imbalance within the relationship, in that
 one spouse performs the bulk of the work without being recognized for it.
 This may often be the case with tedious work such as weeding or domestic
 work and household chores.
 Disagreement characterized by one spouse under-reporting own labour contributio
n may point to some degree of shirking.
 For example, it may be that the female co-head does not have a clear idea
 of how long it takes to spray a particular plot and the male co-head exploits
 this information asymmetry by making her believe that it took much longer
 than the time it actually took; the time difference is then used for private
 activities by the male co-head that do not directly contribute to the household
 as a whole.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results from our intervention show that only the second intervention has
 an impact on disagreement related to spouses' labour contributions.
 This suggests that cultural factors are less important.
 While the effect of facilitating mutual monitoring on shirking is not clear,
 we do see that arming spouses with information reduces the likelihood that
 spouses provide more labour than they get credit for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen that some studies interpret cases of over-reporting related
 to marketing behaviour and income derived from farming activities as signs
 that spouses are hiding income from each other 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "castilla2012ties"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this case, we would have expected that the second intervention would
 be most effective in reducing disagreement.
 The fact that we only find an impact from the couple role model video suggests
 that disagreement related to sales is caused by cultural factors.
 For instance, our findings would be consistent with a situation where a
 male co-head exaggerates sales to his spouse because he wants to be seen
 as the provider, but after seeing a video where both spouses are equally
 providing for the household, the male co-head reports sales that are more
 in line with what the female co-head thinks the male co-head sold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Household surveys that are serious about capturing gender related heterogeneity
 will, at least for part of the survey, interview both male and female co-heads
 separately, as opposed to only the household head or most knowledgeable
 person.
 A common finding in these surveys is that male and female co-heads often
 give substantially different answers to the same questions.
 While some discordance is inevitable due to measurement error, recent studies
 have been searching for patterns in this disagreement, and suggest that
 systematic disagreement between spouses may be key in understanding intra-house
hold power dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies on spousal disagreement often use a simple binary variable indicating
 that the answer of one co-head differs (to some degree) from the answer
 of the other co-head.
 In some cases, the direction of disagreement is also considered, differentiatin
g for instance between cases where husbands report higher levels of consumption
 than wives, and cases where husbands report lower levels of consumption
 than wives.
 Often, these questions relate to household level data, such as consumption
 expenditure of investment in household public goods.
 However, studies interested in women autonomy and women empowerment go
 further and ask more personal questions on behaviour and personal belongings,
 and spouses are typically asked to answer these questions about themselves
 but also about their spouse.
 This own and cross reporting allows for a range of interesting indicators
 of disagreement to be constructed based on what one co-head claims about
 his or her own behaviour (or asset ownership), and what his or her spouse
 thinks he or she did (or owns).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we focused mostly on directional disagreement indicators
 that exploit questions about individual spouses obtained from both co-heads.
 In addition to documenting patterns in spousal disagreement in this way,
 we also tested two simple interventions aimed at reducing disagreement
 related to decision making, labour contributions and marketing.
 Both interventions consisted of showing short engaging video's to co-heads
 within the household.
 More in particular, in a first intervention we tested if promoting a cooperativ
e approach to maize farming (by showing a couple farming together) reduced
 disagreement.
 In a second treatment we vary who gets to see the video to test if reducing
 information asymmetry between spouses also reduced disagreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found substantial disagreement between spouses.
 For instance, we found that co-heads exaggerate their own decision making
 power on almost one in four plots.
 We found significant reductions in the likelihood that co-heads overstate
 own influence as a result of the couple role model intervention for the
 decisions related to timing of planting and weeding.
 We did not find that the couple role model treatment reduced the likelihood
 that spouses understate own decision making.
 We found that reducing information asymmetry between spouses led to a reduction
 in the likelihood that one spouse assigns him or herself more decision
 power than the other spouse claimed.
 The likelihood that spouses understated their own contribution also reduced
 as a result of providing both spouses with the same information, but the
 effect was never significant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For labour, we found that spouses seem to relatively overstate their own
 labour and understate their spouses labour.
 However, we also found a substantial part of the sample where a co-head
 reported to work less than what the other thinks.
 We find that, to some extent, the likelihood that spouses overstate own
 labour contributions reduced as a result of providing spouses with information
 that allows them to better monitor each other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For marketing, spouses tend to overstate own sales, suggesting some degree
 of income hiding.
 Promoting cooperation within the household reduced the likelihood and degree
 of one spouse reporting lower sales than what the other spouse assumed.
 The fact that we did not find an impact on over-reporting of sales suggests
 disagreement does not stem from deliberate income hiding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that we find similar effects from both interventions suggest that
 two distinct mechanisms are likely at play.
 On the one hand, some of the disagreement may be because one spouse overestimat
es his or her own role or position to make it appear in line with expectations
 within communities.
 Reducing this disagreement will involve longer run efforts to challenge
 perceptions and gender stereotypes.
 Recent research has found that role models may be particularly effective
 for this 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "beaman2009powerful,porter2019gender"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, some disagreement may reflect deliberate appropriation
 of decisions, shirking, or income hiding.
 Here, interventions aimed as reducing the information disadvantage of one
 spouse, may be effective.
