Grabbing, Shirking and Hiding: Spousal Disagreement among Ugandan Maize
 farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To gain a better understanding of intra-household bargaining processes,
 surveys increasingly collect data from co-heads individually.
 Answers provided by spouses on the same set of questions often differ substanti
ally, and while this is partly due to measurement error, there is also some
 signal in the noise.
 Some studies argue that cultural context may lead to systematic bias that
 may be due to a different meaning attached to concepts being elicited.
 Others suggest that at least part of the disagreement originates from spouses
 strategically hiding information from each other.
 Using detailed data on a large sample of monogamous smallholder maize farming
 households in eastern Uganda, we document patterns in spousal disagreement
 in reporting related to decision making, labour time and sales.
 We also implement two light weight interventions to test if we can reduce
 disagreement by increasing cooperation between spouses and reducing information
 asymmetries.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Increased attention for the inner workings of the household farm by both
 researchers and practitioners led to various innovations in data collection

.
 One example is the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), a comprehen
sive and standardized measure to directly measure womenâ€™s empowerment and
 inclusion in the agricultural sector 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The focus on intra-household processes has also substantially increased
 the availability of data that is collected at the individual household
 member level, especially from the co-heads of the households.
 Studies that collect data from male and female co-heads separately find
 that spouses often provide different answers on even the most basic questions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

 demonstrate that while part of the this may be due to measurement error,
 there is also a systematic component that reflects asymmetric information
 within households where one co-head does not have accurate knowledge about
 the decisions made, actions taken, or assets owned of the other.
 Furthermore, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argue that the fact that spousal disagreement in reporting is larger for
 assets that can be hidden more easily than for others suggests that, to
 some extent, spouses exploit these information asymmetries by deliberately
 hiding assets and decisions from each other.
 A number of lab-in-the-field experiments indeed confirm that household
 members conceal resources from one another

\end_inset

.
 However, it may also be that prevailing gender norms result in such a bias,
 if for example male co-heads start exaggerating when asked about issues
 they are assumed to be responsible for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We contribute to this line of research by documenting spousal disagreement
 in reported behaviour among a large sample of semi-subsistance maize farming
 household in Uganda.
 First, on a range of decisions that are crucial to increase yields such
 as timely planting, seed spacing and weeding, we ask both spouses to indicate
 who made each decision on each plot.
 Spouses can indicate they took the decision alone, that their spouse took
 the decision alone, or that the decision was taken jointly.
 These answers are then combined to assess the degree of disagreement with
 respect to decision making.
 Second, we ask each spouse separately how much time he or she spent on
 each of five important maize farming related activities (land preparation,
 planting, weeding, spraying, and harvesting) on each plot.
 We also ask each co-head to provide an estimate of how much time his or
 her spouse spent on these same activities.
 We combine these answers to construct a measure of shirking, where one
 spouse devotes less time on a particular activity than his or her spouse
 thinks.
 Finally, we ask each co-head how much maize he of she sold unilaterally
 (as opposed to joint sales) and also ask each co-head to provide an estimate
 of how much his or her spouses sold alone.
 We again combine this information to reflect income hiding, where one spouse
 reports more sales than the other spouse is aware of.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to documenting patterns in spousal disagreement, the paper also
 tests two simple interventions aimed at reducing disagreement related to
 decision making, shirking and income hiding.
 Inspired by recent research on behavioral change communication and social
 marketing, a first intervention consists of a video treatment that promotes
 a mental model of farming as a joint venture, with both spouses having
 an equal role in decision making, activities, and rewards.
 A second intervention focuses more on reducing information asymmetry between
 spouses.
 By making sure both spouses have similar information about what decision
 need to be made, what labour is required and what yields can be expected,
 spouses are expected to be better able to monitor each other and provide
 better estimates of each other's efforts.
 We think that the second intervention will be relatively more effective
 if spouses engage in intentional concealment, while the first may reduce
 the likelihood that spouses feel they need to report behaviour that is
 more in line with norms and customs.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The next section gives
 a brief overview of the literature on spousal disagreement.
 We then present the experimental design and explain the rationale underlying
 the intervention.
 Next is a brief section describing the context and the characteristics
 of the households in our sample.
 We then turn to the results, first looking at how the interventions affect
 disagreement about decision making.
 This is followed by a section on disagreement on labour and disagreement
 related to maize sales.
 A final section concludes.

\begin_layout Section
Literature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we review related literature.
 We mainly focus on the empirical empowerment literature that uses observational
 data from surveys in which both spouses are interviewed separately and
 are asked the same set of questions.
 Such studies are often interested in learning about women's autonomy.
 For example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1728-4465.2002.00299.x"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 asks both spouses questions on the locus of decision making on a variety
 of issues, as well as specific questions concerning women's mobility and
 access to resources.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"

\end_inset

 collect data from both spouses on a range of autonomy items, including
 the need of the woman to obtain the husband's permission to go to a set
 of places, the mother's capacity to decide on the children's affairs, if
 women are allowed to have a job, their role in deciding on the number of
 children and some household expenditure related decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common finding in studies that ask the same set of questions to different
 individuals within the household is substantial disagreement between spouses,
 even on questions that would seem uncontroversial such as the number of
 children.
 This may indicate that part of this is simply due to measurement error.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggests that disagreement is also partly due the fact that that the response
 categories do not have the same cognitive or semantic meanings to men and
 women, leading to the somewhat pessimistic conclusion that survey questions
 are of limited utility for understanding differences in gender stratification
 across context.
 A number of studies investigate whether disagreement in responses of spouses
 on the same question means something, or if this should just be discounted
 as noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "SEYMOUR201897"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the primary focus is on testing if sole decision making correlates differently
 to a measure of autonomy than joint decision making.
 However, they note spouses often give inconsistent answers when asked who
 decided, and also consider how these correlations are affected by this
 disagreement between spouses.
 They conclude that disagreement may signal underlying power dynamics within
 the household that are likely to be relevant when assessing individual
 level agency and empowerment.

\end_inset

 may be problematic for interventions seeking to use survey data to develop
 and inform strategies for reducing gender inequalities or empowering women
 in rural agricultural households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One particularly insightful study that tries to separate signal from noise
 is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"

\end_inset

.
 They develop a conceptual model that differentiates between three explanations
 for spousal disagreement.
 First, they note that if disagreement solely derives from measurement error,
 disagreement should be symmetric, and the female co-head's responses should
 not differ differ systematically from the male co-head's responses.
 Secondly, they test for asymmetric measurement error, where men and women
 interpret questions differently.
 In this case, answers may differ systematically between spouses, but disagreeme
nt should be similar for the different questions asked in the survey.
 Finally, they argue that finding differing rates of disagreement across
 survey questions, and higher disagreement for assets and activities that
 are easier to hide in particular, points to asymmetric information.
 Using observational data on decision making and asset ownership in Bangladesh,
 they find that asymmetric information in the form of hidden assets and
 decisions is present in the households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, while most studies on spousal disagreement seem to assume that
 information asymmetry is a sign that individuals hide resources or actions
 from other household members, information asymmetry does not always have
 to be the result of one spouse intentionally deceiving another.
 There may be other systematic biases that manifest more in one asset or
 decision category than others and are shaped by prevailing gender norms.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that in a careful case study in northern Uganda, men often report
 unilateral decision making in areas where they are assumed to bear final
 responsibility, even if women had some degree of involvement.
 Women tented to view these scenarios as joint decisions.
 As such, it is important to understand the local cultural context to differenti
ate between information asymmetry stemming form intentional hiding and disagreem
ent that is more superficial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANNAN2021105292"

\end_inset

 is another powerful illustration of the conceptual and analytical value
 of intra-household contention over decision-making.
 The primary contribution of this paper is that it does not simply consider
 disagreement as a binary variable, but argues that the direction of the
 disagreement may also be important for assessing agency and empowerment.
 More in particular, they differentiate cases in which men disagree that
 women are involved in decision making from cases where men disagree that
 women are not involved in decision making.
 The former is interpreted as women 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

taking power
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, while in the second case women are

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In surveys where women autonomy is central, spouses are often simply asked
 if the other spouse has a say in decisions being made with a simple yes/no
 questions, allowing for four categories (man says woman was included and
 woman agrees, woman says she was included and man agrees, man says woman
 was included while women disagrees, and woman says she was included and
 man disagrees).
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
These days, most studies that focus on decision making acknowledge that
 the majority of decisions are made jointly, and a category is added: spouses
 are asked to indicate if a decision was made by themselves, by the other,
 or jointly, leading to nine possible combinations.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Questions related to asset ownership also generally take a binary nature,
 asking for each asset if the respondent owns it but also requiring if the
 spouse owns it.
 Some studies go further and try to put amounts on this.
 For example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "castilla2012ties"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 uses the husband's own reporting of his own farm income and compares this
 to the wifeâ€™s reporting of the husband's farm income to identify income
 hiding by men.
 She finds that the women's estimate farm income is on average 28 thousand
 Cedis lower than what men report, representing 14 per cent of household
 income.
 In Malawi, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "FISHER2010966"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 finds that in 66% of households in their sample, the husband underestimated
 his wifeâ€™s income by an average of 47%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the above studies are descriptive in nature, exploring patterns in agreement
 and disagreement in decision making, asset ownership and income.
 The emerging consensus is that disagreement has real effects on important
 outcomes.
 Therefore, we agree with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANNAN2021105292"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that more research is needed to understand which interventions move the
 needle on womenâ€™s taking of power, versus the husband giving her power
 or couples agreeing.
 Therefor, in the next section, we describe two interventions designed to
 reduce disagreement among spouses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Experimental design and Interventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The emerging literature on spousal disagreement suggests at least two underlying
 mechanism.
 First, to some extent, spousal disagreement may reflect different cognitive
 understandings of the responses categories and what the appropriate response
 should be 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This problem is compounded by the cultural context in which these questions
 are asked and answered 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A first treatment therefore attempts to challenge pre-conceived ideas of
 what decision making of a spouse involves and who is expected to make decisions
 in a farm household.
 Second, the literature also establishes that spousal disagreement reflects
 information asymmetry between spouses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A second intervention tests if this informational imbalance can be influenced
 by giving spouses equal ex-ante knowledge on maize farming best practices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the heart of both treatments is a short video that is shown to individuals
 within households using tablet computers.
 The aim of the video was to increase knowledge of the viewer with respect
 to best practices in maize farmer, such as timely planting, row planting
 and the use of improved inputs such hybrid seed and inorganic fertilizer.
 It does this though an inspirational story where a farmer (or farmers)
 recount how he/she/they used to be poor but managed to increase yields
 over time by applying a set of techniques and inputs.
 It thus encourages farmers to view maize growing as a business that needs
 investment to grow over time.
 Some simple inter-temporal cost-benefit calculations are use to illustrate
 this.
 Viewers are encouraged to follow the example of the model farmer in the
 video if they also want to lead the good life.
 The treatments itself consist of slightly adapted version of the video
 and variations on who within the household was exposed to the video.
 These variation and the rationale behind it are explained below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Gender roles within the household
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within households, individual members often have differing spheres of influence,
 resulting in some degree of division of labour reflecting traditional gender
 roles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lundberg1993separate"

\end_inset

.
 Gendered differences in crop diversity choices may emerge from a variety
 of factors, including gender related differences in knowledge about the
 crop, access to planting material, and customs and traditions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "NORDHAGEN2021105134"

\end_inset

 While the existence of such gendered patterns are widely acknowledged,
 it is not always easy to capture this in data, as gender is only one of
 the determinants of crop portfolio choice

key "CARR2008900,DOSS20021987"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In in patrilineal societies such as Uganda, maize is considered to be mostly
 in the influence sphere of men.
 Generally, men will make all important decisions such as on what plots
 to plant, how to prepare the land, when to start planting and what seeds
 to use.
 Men also generally decide on how much labour is needed, and women assist
 men, often with weeding.
 Women generally have a larger voice in the cultivation of food security
 crops such as cassava or sweet potato.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We expect that such a separation in spheres of influence between male and
 female co-head contributes to spousal disagreement.
 Therefor, we devised a treatment consisting of an adaptation of the video
 featuring role models to promote a worldview where both spouses participate
 equally in maize farming.
 Recent research has shown that role models may be important to increase
 women participation in otherwise male dominated sectors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "porter2019gender,beaman2012female"

\end_inset

 One way in which large groups of people can be exposed to role models is
 through engaging media content 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 In the context of smallholder agriculture, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 find that exposure to video that show life stories of successful farmers
 affected both viewersâ€™ investment in their childrenâ€™s education and other
 future-oriented behaviors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test the hypothesis that spouses disagree less if they view farming as
 a collective activity, we randomly selected 261 households from our sample
 and showed them (male and female co-heads together) a version of the video
 where a couple is depicted.
 In another random sample of 475 households, we showed exactly the same
 video, except for the fact that it only featured a single actor: either
 a man or a woman.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We made sure that in about half of the cases this was an actor alone and
 in the other half an actress alone.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 As the only difference between the two videos was the fact that in one
 video a single actor appeared and in the other a couple was shown, any
 difference in outcomes between the two groups should be attributed to a
 couple role model effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Information asymmetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Smallholder agricultural households consist of different individuals, each
 with their own preferences, skills and access to assets.
 At the same time, individuals also need to invest in common goods for the
 survival of both the unit and its members.
 There are also various shared assets and resources from which individual
 household members draw.
 As such, households can be considered as institutions, governed by its
 own rules with members that have a particular place within the hierarchy.
 The means that many of the problems encountered in common pool resource
 management and collective action, such as free-riding and over-extraction
 of resources also apply within the household 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doss2015collective"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way in which collective action problems can be attenuated is through
 increased mutual monitoring.
 For instance, if one co-head can better asses the actual time that the
 other co-head worked on preparing the field, the latter will be less likely
 to engage in shirking.
 Or, if it becomes easier to check how much each co-head obtained from the
 sale of maize, instances of income hiding will decrease.
 However, in order for monitoring to work, co-heads need to have a good
 idea of what to compare against, as merely observing an outcome may be
 insufficient to determine if a co-head cheated.
 For instance, it may be difficult for the female co-head to check if a
 the male co-head over-reports time spent preparing the field if she does
 not have a good understanding of what land preparation entails.
 If both spouses have a good understanding of what agricultural management
 entails, they are also in a better position to monitor each other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a second treatment, we therefore make sure both co-heads start off with
 the same information with respect to best agronomic practices, as this
 will enable increased mutual monitoring.
 To do so, we show the video that showcases best practices in maize farming
 to both spouses in a random sample of 261 households.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 only to one of the two co-heads.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We again made sure that in about half of the cases the video was shown to
 the male co-head alone and in the other half of cases to the female co-head
 alone.

 As the only difference between the two groups is related to whom the video
 was shown to, any difference in outcomes between the two groups should
 be attributed to reducing information asymmetry between spouses.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study involved a among a random sample of maize farmers in eastern Uganda,
 an area that is know for its maize production.
 Two-stage cluster sampling was used to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, from five districts (Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo,
 and Namutumba), we first selected 50 parishes randomly and in proportion
 to the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all the households, from which we sampled
 10 households to be included in the study.
 This resulted in a total sample size of 3,280 households.
 However, to investigate cooperation within the household, we only use household
s where we managed to interview both spouses separately, which was the case
 in 2,548 households.
 The intervention was only implemented on a subset of the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We focus on the second maize growing season of 2017, which runs from about
 August, when fields are prepared to January when harvesting is done in
 higher altitude areas.
 The video intervention happened twice, once in August when farmers were
 preparing and once in September during planting time.
 Concurrent with the first treatment, we also collected some information
 on household characteristics and on the previous harvest, which was the
 first harvesting season of 2017.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmers in our study area cultivate on average about 1.5 plots of maize.
 Yields during the first season of 2017 were extremely low (about 270 kilograms
 per acre) as a result of the Fall Armyworm invasion.
 The baseline data also shows that the average household head is 40 years
 old and only about 60 percent did not finish primary education.
 The average household consists of almost 8 individuals.
 Only 11 percent of households report that that had access to extension
 in the year prior to the survey.
 Only 17 percent used fertilizer on at least one plot, and 34 percent reported
 to be using hybrid maize seed or an open pollinated variety.
 About three quarters reported that the household had owned a mobile phone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now turn to an in depth analysis of the data that was collected at endline.
 The focus is on spousal disagreement using own and cross reporting.
 We start by looking at patterns in decision making about a series of important
 maize cultivation practices.
 We then turn time use, again disaggregated by a set of important tasks.
 Finally, we look at market participation.
 Under each heading, we provide a detailed descriptive analysis of disagreement
 based on the entire sample, and then report on the findings from the two
 treatment in the respective sub-samples.

In this section,we start by exploring patterns of decision making related
 to maize growing within the household.
 We asked the head of the household to list all maize plots that the household
 was cultivating during the season preceding the survey, which was the second
 agricultural seasons of 2017.
 We then cycle through the different plots and repeat a series of questions
 for each plot.
 The same questions were asked separately to each co-head.
 We asked, for a range of key decisions that need to be made and that are
 known to significantly affect maize yields, who made the decision on that
 particular plot.
 Respondents could answer that decisions were made by the person that was
 interviewed alone; by the spouse of the person interviewed alone; by the
 person interviewed and his or her spouse jointly; by someone else inside
 or outside the household; by the person interviewed together with someone
 else inside or outside the household; or by the spouse jointly with someone
 else inside or outside the household.
 Respondents could also indicate that they did not know who made the decision.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by looking at the responses given by the male co-heads within the
 household (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision-making"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The first decision we consider was simply who decided maize should be planted
 on the particular plot.
 A second decision is related to timing of planting.
 Timely planting of maize is very important for subsequent maize yields.
 Maize planting should start immediately after the first rains of the season,
 resulting in significant time pressure when large areas need to be planted.
 A third important decision that maize farmers have to make is related to
 the spacing of seed and seed rate.
 There is a wide range of seed methods used by farmers.
 Some simply broadcast the seeds.
 However, row planting leads to significantly higher yields as plants have
 optimal space to obtain sufficient sun and nutrients.
 Farmers also often plant more than one seed per hill, because they fear
 some seeds may not geminate.
 However, planting more than one seed per hill may also increase competition
 for light and nutrients, leading to stunted growth.
 It is therefore recommended to use only one seed per hill and engage in
 gap filling when seeds do not germinate after one week.
 We also asked who made decisions related to weed control.
 For weeding, we differentiate between decision making related to strategies
 used to combat striga infestations and weeding more general.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows that, at least according to the male co-head, joint decision making
 is the norm.
 For example, on the 3,723 maize plots on which data was collected, men
 indicate that on 1,947 plots the decision to start planting maize was taken
 together with the wife.
 This corresponds to about 52 percent of plots.
 The pattern seems to be rather consistent across the different decision
 spheres.
 For the decision on how to fight striga, the percentage drops to 42 percent,
 but this is due to the fact that part of the plots, striga was not a problem
 and so no decision needed to be made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure also shows that on one out of three plots, the male co-head states
 that decisions are made by him alone, without consulting his wife.
 Also here, the percentages remain stable across the decision makings spheres,
 with a slightly higher incidence of male co-head unilateral decision making
 on spacing and slightly less unilateral male decision making on weeding.
 Finally, the figure also shows that, according to men, women decide to
 plant maize without consulting their husband on 414 out of the total 3,723
 plots, corresponding to about 11 percent.
 This share is also stable over the five decision spheres considered in
 the figure, with slightly more decisions taken by women on weeding and
 slight less on seed spacing.

, but now shows responses as provided by the female co-head.
 Also here, we see that women report that decisions are generally made jointly:
 on the 3,723 maize plots in the sample, the woman co-head indicates that
 on 1,892 plots the decision to start planting maize was taken by the male
 and female co-head together.
 Also for the other decisions, on about half of all plots women say the
 decision was made jointly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Women also report that it is more common that men take decisions alone than
 that women take decisions alone.
 For instance, women report that on 1,015 out of the 3,723 maize plots,
 man took the decision to start planting without consulting anyone else.
 However, there is less consistency over the different decision spheres.
 Men are relatively less likely to unilaterally decide on weeding related
 activities.
 Finally, women report that they make decisions unilaterally on about 15
 percent of the plots.

 suggest some degree of disagreement between spouses.
 For instance, while male co-heads indicated that they alone took the decision
 to plant maize on about 32 percent of the plots, women say that man unilaterall
y took the decision to plant maize on only 27 percent of the plots.
 At the same time, female co-heads say they alone decided to plant maize
 on 16 percent of the plots.
 Men indicate that women unilaterally decided to plant maize on only 11
 percent of the plots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate this disagreement further, we can construct measures based
 on answers of both spouses.
 As there are a large number of potential response combinations, it is customary
 to collapse responses into a few meaningful categories to reduce noise
 and facilitate analysis.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 define a variable for cases where the wife says that she is involved (alone
 or joint), but the husband says she is not and a variable for cases where
 the husband says the wife is involved but she reports that she is not.
 In this study, we follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANNAN2021105292"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and define plots on which co-heads overestimate their own role in decision
 making.
 These are instances where the one co-head responds that decisions are made
 by him or her alone, but the spouse says she or he was involved (either
 alone or as part of the couple), and instances where the co-head says decisions
 were taken jointly but the spouse says she or he took the decisions alone.
 We further define instances where co-heads underestimate their own role
 in decision making.
 These are cases where one co-head says his or her spouse decided unilaterally,
 but the spouse says the co-head was involved (either alone or as part of
 the couple), and cases where the co-head says the decision was made jointly,
 but the spouse says the co-head took the decision alone

 refer to the first measure as instances where the female co-head

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the second measure is interpreted as the male co-head 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 These terms are somewhat contentious, as such an interpretation rests on
 assumptions.
 For instance, in cases where both spouses indicate that they themselves
 took a particular decision, the interpretation that the women 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is only valid if we assume all power rests with the male co-head to begin
 with, and we believe that the female co-head is correct while the male
 co-head is not (assuming that they can not both have taken the decision
 unilaterally).

 they made the decision alone.
 At the same time, we see that on about 17 percent of all plots, the female
 co-head thinks she was involved in the decision to plant maize, but the
 male co-head indicates he made the decision alone.

 shows that among household where a video was shown where one individual
 provided the information (the control group), on about 10 percent of the
 plots the female co-head says she took the decision to plant maize alone
 while the male co-head thinks he was involved in this decision

, but now in the smaller sample of households included in our experiment.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The second column shows the average treatment effect of the treatment and
 reveals that there is no effect of the treatment on this outcome.
 This comparison between those who saw the couple video and those who saw
 a video with a single actor is repeated for all five decision spheres.
 We do find a significant impact of the intervention on the the likelihood
 that women disagree that the man was involved in decisions related to weeding.
 Here we see that among households where the video was shown with a single
 actor providing all the information, women say they took the decision related
 to weeding alone while men think they were involved on 12.5 percent of plots.
 Among households that were exposed to the video the features a couple,
 this type of disagreement occurs on only 8.4 percent of plots.

\begin_layout Standard
In the third column, we report control group means for the share of plots
 on which women claim they were involved in decision making but men say
 they took the decision unilaterally.
 Again in line with Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision"
plural "false"

\end_inset

, we see for instance that this type of disagreement on when to plant maize
 applies to about 18 percent of the plots.
 The fourth column shows that disagreement on the timing reduced by 6.3 percentag
e points among households that received the couple role model treatment.
 We also see a significant reduction in men disagreeing that women were
 involved in decisions related to spacing of maize seed.
 More generally, for the couple role model treatment, while not all coefficients
 are statistically significant, they are all negative, indicating that the
 treatment reduced disagreement with respect to decision making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next turn to the second treatment and compare disagreement on decision
 making between co-heads in households where only one co-head viewed the
 video and households where the video was shown to both co-heads.
 Column 5 of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:decisions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 show that in households where only one of the co-heads was exposed to the
 video, the female co-head said she decided to plant maize alone while the
 male co-head thought he was involved in this decision on about 13 percent
 of the plots.
 Column 6 indicates that this percentage was 3.1 percentage points lower
 among households where both spouses was shown the video, although the reduction
 in disagreement is not statistically different from zero.
 We do, however, find significant reductions in this type of disagreement
 for decisions related to spacing and weeding among households where both
 spouses were treated with the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the last two columns, we look at the impact of providing both spouses
 with the same information on the likelihood that the male co-head says
 he took the decision alone while the female co-head thinks she was involved.
 Control group means are again in close to what we find in the entire sample
 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 We find again that disagreement reduced somewhat as a result of targeting
 both spouses with information, but only for decisions relate to the timing
 of planting and the difference is only significant at the 10 percent significan
t level.
 However, also for this treatment, all but one of the coefficients are estimated
 negative, suggesting that overall, targeting the couple with information
 instead on only one co-head reduced disagreement with respect to decision
 making in agriculture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Labour time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also collected detailed information on labour.
 On each maize plot, we ask each co-head how much time, expressed in labour
 days, he or she worked on a particular activity.
 We also ask each co-head to give an estimate of how much time his or her
 spouse worked on the plot on that particular task.
 The activities we inquired about are land preparation, planting, weeding,
 spraying and harvesting.
 Weeding happens at three different times, but is aggregated into one measure
 for this analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-spent-man"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 shows time spent on different activities as reported by the male co-head.
 We see that the male co-head spends about 8 days preparing the plot, 2
 days planting, almost 15 days weeding, one day of spraying and another
 2 days harvesting.
 The figure also shows that the male co-head reports that his wife spends
 one day less in preparing the land and also half a day less in weeding.
 Men think women almost never engage in spraying of insecticides, herbicides
 or fungicides.
 The average male co-head in our sample thus reports to work about 28 days
 on the average plot over the entire agricultural season.
 He reports that women work about 26 days on that plot over the entire season.

, but now as reported by the female co-head within the household.
 Interestingly, while male co-heads think they spent more time on all activities
, female co-heads are also of the opinion that they work harder than men
 on all activities, the only exception being spraying.
 Female co-heads claim they work on average about 7 to 8 days on field preparati
on on a plot, while they think the male co-head only work 6 days.
 Female co-heads also indicate that they spend 16.5 days on weeding, while
 men spend only 13.5 days on that activity.
 Male and female co-heads spend about the same time on planting and harvesting.
 Only for spraying, they agree that the male co-head provides most of the
 work.
 According to the female co-head, she works almost 30 days, while the male
 co-head works about 25 days over the entire season.

 again suggests substantial disagreement between spouses on time worked.
 For instance, we see that male co-heads report that they work on average
 about 8 days to prepare the land, yet women indicate that men only work
 6 days to prepare the land.
 Women on the other hand report that they work on average 16 days on the
 field to weed, while men think that women only work 14 days on the field
 for weeding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While on average, spouses tend to overestimate their own labour and underestimat
e their spouses labour, there is also a substantial part of the sample where
 a co-head reports to work less than what the other thinks.
 We will refer to this type of disagreement in labour reported as shirking.
 For the analysis, we define shirking as a simple binary event where a male
 co-head shirks on a particular activity if he reports he worked fewer hours
 than his wife thinks.
 A female co-head shirks if she works less than the male co-head thinks.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Shirking"

 shows shirking by spouses.
 For example, we find that on about 30 percent of the plots, the male co-head
 spends less time preparing the land than the female co-head thinks he does.
 For the task of preparing the land, women shirk slightly more.
 However, in general, the figure indicates male co-heads shirk more than
 female co-heads.
 Shirking is highest for men when it comes to weeding: On 40 percent of
 the plots, male co-heads put in less time than their female co-head thinks
 he does.

Income hiding

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at maize sales.
 Also here, we asked each spouse separately how much maize was sold from
 the season under consideration.
 In particular, we asked each of the spouses separately to estimate how
 much was sold by (1) him or her, (2) by his or her spouse, and (3) jointly

 We also asked them to indicate the revenue that was derived from these
 sales.

Men report that households sold on average 1.4 bags of maize as a couple

.
 Women report that they sold just under one bag as a household.
 Averaged over the entire sample, joint sales amounted to about 23 dollars,
 at least as reported by the male co-head.
 Women estimated this amount much lower at 13 dollars.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As this paper is more about spousals disagreement, we focus on unilateral
 sales as reported by both spouses.

 shows in the left panel that men reported they sold half a bag themselves.
 Women reported that the male co-head only sold 0.25 bags of maize.
 This may indicate that the average male co-head in our sample sold about
 one quarter of a bag behind the female co-head's back.
 Women, on the other hand, report that they sold only about 12 kilograms
 of maize alone.
 Men think that the female co-head unilaterally sold about 6 kilograms.
 As such, in percentage terms, quantities hidden is similar between male
 and female co-heads.

The right panel of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 looks at income derived from these sales.
 Male co-heads indicate that they received about 7.6 dollars on average from
 their unilateral sales of maize.
 Women estimate this revenue to be only about 2 dollar.
 The fact that the gap between what men report and what women report has
 increased dramatically may indicate that men also hide income by reporting
 to the female co-head lower prices than what they actually received for
 the maize.
 This seems to be less the case for women, where differences in male and
 female reported revenues are in line with differences in quantities sold.

As in previous sections, we look at the impact of the two interventions
 on disagreement related to maize sales.
 We conjecture that encouraging cooperation and reducing information asymmetries
 between spouses may lead to a reduction in income hiding.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 reports results for three outcomes.
 A first outcome is a simple binary indicator that takes the value of one
 if a spouse appears to engage in concealing sales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first row in the table shows that among households that were shown a
 video with only one actor, about 14 percent of male co-heads sold more
 than what the female co-head thought.
 In this same subset, about 6 percent of female co-heads sold more than
 what the male co-head thought the female co-head sold.
 We do not find that these rates are significantly different among households
 that were given the couple role model treatment video.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, the right panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:income_hiding"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 reports result for the second treatment.
 It shows that there is also no impact of providing both spouses with the
 same information on the likelihood that spouses engage in income hiding.
 We further consider quantities hidden in rows 3 and 4 of the table, and
 translate this into income obtained from selling these quantities in rows
 5 and 6.
 Overall, we do not find that our interventions affect disagreement related
 to maize sales.

Further, household surveys where expenditure and income of the entire household

 However, when imperfect information flows exist between household members

When spouses choose to exploit their information advantages by hiding income,
 they must allocate resources away from goods that can easily be monitored,
 which can result in underinvestment in household goods.
 Child human capital investments, such as education and nutrition, tend
 to be easily monitored.
 These investments have important spillover effects in a householdâ€™s ability
 to step out of poverty because they increase child productivity later in
 life, providing further sources of income diversification to the household
 (Duflo 2001; Rosenzweig 1990).
