\begin_layout Abstract
To gain a better understanding of intra-household bargaining processes,
 surveys increasingly collect data from co-heads individually.
 Answers provided by spouses on the same set of questions often differ substanti
ally
\change_inserted 973716962 1617700256
, alternately attributed to measurement error, poor framing within the cultural
 context that leads to systematic biases, or other common challenges associated
 with surveys.
 
\change_deleted 973716962 1617700262
, and while this is partly due to measurement error, there is also some
 signal in the noise.
 Some studies argue that cultural context may lead to systematic bias that
 may be due to a different meaning attached to concepts being elicited.

\change_unchanged
 
\change_inserted 973716962 1617700348
However, recent studies suggest that differences in responses from co-heads
 may also be caused by 
\change_deleted 973716962 1617700318
Others suggest that at least part of the disagreement originates from
\change_unchanged
 spouses strategically hiding information from each other.
 Using detailed data on a large sample of monogamous smallholder maize farming
 households in eastern Uganda, we document patterns in

Examples of best practice in data collection on

The focus on

intra-household decision-making processes 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618296396
include separate interviewing of male and female co-heads of the household
 using distinct survey instruments that may nonetheless contain common topics
 and questions
\change_deleted 973716962 1618296288
has also substantially increased the availability of data that is collected

Both interventions aim to influence intra-household gender relations in
 a slightly different way—one by a behavioral nudge and one with an information
 treatment—to affect change not only in co-heads' approach to decision-making
 on cultivation and management practices, timing, labor time allocations,
 and yield expectations, but also in 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618297987
By making sure both spouses have similar information about eg.
 what decision need to be made, what labour is required, and what yields
 can be expected, spouses are expected to be better able to

spouses
\change_inserted 1966826031 1618414165

farm relative to their spouse's contribution.
 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618298159
and understate their spouses labour.
 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618298214
Conversely, 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618298217
However, 
\change_unchanged
we also find a substantial 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618298236
share of co-heads 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618298231
part of the sample where a co-head

\change_inserted 973716962 1618298241

to 
\change_unchanged
work less than what the other 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618298245
spouse 
\change_unchanged
thinks.
 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618302257
We further observe that, to some extent, a reduction in information asymmetries
 beween spouses tends to reduce to the likelihood that a co-head overstates
 his or her own labor contribution
\change_deleted 1966826031 1618414196
s
\change_inserted 973716962 1618302257
, indicating an increase in monitoring capacity within the household.
\change_deleted 973716962 1618298413
We find that, to some extent, the likelihood that spouses overstate own
 labour contributions reduces as a result of providing spouses with information
 that allows them to better monitor each other.

\begin_layout Standard
A common finding in studies that ask the same set of questions to different
 individuals within the household is 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618299060
that there is often 
\change_unchanged
substantial disagreement between spouses, even on questions that would seem
 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618299093
easily and objectively verifiable 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618299083
straightforward to verify objectively 
\change_unchanged
such as the number of children
\change_inserted 973716962 1618299098
,
\change_unchanged
 or type of material used for house construction.
 This 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618299118
divergence may 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618299121
may indicate that part of this divergence is

simply 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618299125

\change_deleted 973716962 1618299126

\change_inserted 1966826031 1618414660
may
\change_unchanged
 also partly 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1618414667
be 
\change_unchanged

\change_deleted 973716962 1618299634
, the primary focus is on testing if sole decision making correlates differently
 to a measure of autonomy than joint decision making.
 However, they note that spouses often give inconsistent answers when asked
 about who made a particular decision.
 This leads them to check if female sole decision making is equally empowering
 if the male co-head disagrees that the women took the decision alone than
 when spouses agree.

\change_unchanged
 They conclude that disagreement may signal underlying power dynamics within
 the household that are likely to be relevant when assessing individual
 level agency and empowerment.

.
 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618300269
They develop a conceptual model that differentiates between three explanations
 for spousal disagreement.
 
\change_unchanged
First, they note that if disagreement solely derives from measurement error,
 disagreement should be symmetric, and the female co-head's responses should
 not differ systematically from the male co-head's responses.
 Second
\change_deleted 1966826031 1618415627
ly
\change_unchanged
, they 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618300322
point out that if disagreement results from 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618300324
test for a
\change_inserted 1966826031 1618415605
a
\change_unchanged
symmetric measurement error
\change_deleted 973716962 1618300328
,
\change_unchanged
 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618300055
where
\change_inserted 973716962 1618300059
in which
\change_unchanged
 men and women interpret questions differently
\change_inserted 973716962 1618300333
, then 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618300335
.
 In this case,
\change_unchanged
 answers 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618300340
should 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618300341
may 
\change_unchanged
differ systematically between spouses, but disagreement should be similar
 for 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618300294
the 
\change_unchanged
different questions asked in 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618300345
a 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618300300
the 
\change_unchanged
survey.
 Finally, they argue that finding differing rates of disagreement across
 survey questions, and higher 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618300356
rates of 
\change_unchanged
disagreement for assets and activities that are easier to hide in particular,
 points to

The emerging literature on spousal disagreement suggests at least two underlying
 mechanisms.
 First, 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618302142
to some extent, 
\change_unchanged
spousal disagreement may reflect different cognitive understanding of the
 responses categories
\change_inserted 973716962 1618302159
 in a survey questionnaire
\change_unchanged
 and what the appropriate response should be 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This problem is compounded by the cultural context in which these questions
 are asked and answered

key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"

.
 A first treatment therefore attempts to challenge pre-conceived ideas of
 what decision
\change_inserted 973716962 1618302174
-
\change_deleted 973716962 1618302174

 household by promoting a cooperative approach to maize farming, in which
 maize

\change_unchanged

\change_inserted 1966826031 1618416542

\change_unchanged
.

In Uganda, maize, which is in a part a cash crop, is considered to be mostly
 in the influence sphere of men.
 Generally, men
\change_deleted 973716962 1618303050
 will
\change_unchanged
 make all important decisions such as
\change_deleted 973716962 1618303056
 on
\change_unchanged
 what plots to plant maize
\change_inserted 973716962 1618303059

, how to prepare the land, when to start planting
\change_inserted 973716962 1618303062

 and what seeds to use.

At the same time, individuals also need to invest in common goods for the

One way in which collective action problems can be attenuated is through
 increased mutual monitoring.
 For instance, if one co-head can 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618309372
better 
\change_unchanged
assess the actual time that the other co-head 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618309409

\change_inserted 973716962 1618309410

\change_deleted 973716962 1618309438
Or
\change_inserted 973716962 1618309457
Similarly, if a co-head can determine 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618309461
, if it becomes easier to check 
\change_unchanged
how much 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618309464

then
\change_unchanged
 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618309489
the latter is less likely to engage in

instances of 
\change_unchanged
income hiding
\change_deleted 973716962 1618309495
 can be expected to decrease
\change_unchanged
.
 However, in order for mutual monitoring to work, co-heads 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618309506
need to have
\change_inserted 973716962 1618309594
require information against which to compare information gained through
 monitoring, since 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618309535
 a good idea of what to compare against, as 
\change_unchanged
merely observing an outcome may be insufficient to determine if a co-head
 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618309552
is shirking, hiding, or otherwise 
\change_deleted 973716962 1618309567
cheated
\change_inserted 973716962 1618309580
mismanaging their collective obligations to the household
\change_unchanged
.
 
\change_inserted 973716962 1618309693
Thus, information on exactly what operations land preparation entails or
 on the prevailing market price for farm produce are necessary for effective
 monitoring.
 
\change_unchanged
For instance, 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1618417490
knowing what is actually requir
\change_unchanged
it may be difficult for the female co-head to check if her spouse over-reports
 time spent preparing the field if she does not have a good understanding
 of what land preparation entails.
 If both spouses have a good understanding of what agricultural management
 entails, they are also in a better position to monitor each other.

 This resulted in a total sample size of 3,280 households.
 However, in an about 23 percent of the households, we were unable to interview
 both spouses separately, resulting in an effective sample of 2,548 households.

We now turn to an in depth analysis of the data that was collected at endline.
 The focus is on spousal disagreement using own and cross-reporting (that
 is, what one spouse thinks the other spouse would report).
 We start by looking at patterns in decision making about a series of important
 maize cultivation practices.
 We then turn to time use, again disaggregated over a set of important tasks
 in maize cultivation.
 Finally, we look at decisions related to maize marketing.
 Under each heading, we provide a detailed descriptive analysis of disagreement
 based on the entire sample of 2,548 households, and then report on the
 findings from the two treatment in the respective sub-samples.

There is a wide range of seed methods used by farmers in Uganda.
 While some simply broadcast seeds, NARO recommends row planting because
 it results in significantly higher yields since it reduces competition
 between plants for sunlight and soil nutrients.
 Farmers also often plant more than one seed per hill because they fear
 some seeds may not germinate.
 However, planting more than one seed per hill also tends to increase competitio
n for light and nutrients, leading to stunted plant growth.
 It is therefore recommended to use only one seed per hill and engage in
 gap filling when seeds do not germinate after one week.

 In households that were exposed to the couple role model video, the share

In the last two columns, we look at the impact of providing both spouses

\change_inserted 1966826031 1618479654

 correspond to three different outcomes that reflect disagreement in market
 participation.
 The first is a simple binary indicator that takes the value of one if spouses
 indicate they sell more (less) than what the other spouse thinks.
 The second considers actual quantity overstated (understated) by spouses.
 In the third row, we consider disagreement in value reported derived from
 these sales, as we have seen in Figure

 of intra-household dynamics, especially in non-separable agricultural household

 A common finding in these surveys is that male and female co-heads often
 give substantially different answers to the same questions.
 While some discordance is inevitable due to measurement error, recent studies
 have been searching for patterns in this disagreement, and suggest that
 systematic disagreement between spouses may be key in understanding intra-house
