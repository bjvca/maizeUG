Grabbing, Shirking and Hiding: Spousal Disagreement among Ugandan Maize
 farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To gain a better understanding of intra-household bargaining processes,
 surveys increasingly collect data from co-heads individually.
 Answers provided by spouses on the same set of questions often differ substanti
ally, and while this is partly due to measurement error, there is also evidence
 that at least part of this disagreement originates from spouses strategically
 hiding information from each other.
 Using detailed data on a large sample of monogamous smallholder maize farming
 households in eastern Uganda, we document patterns in spousal disagreement
 in reporting related to decision making, labour time and sales.
 We also implement two light weight interventions to test if we can reduce
 disagreement by increasing cooperation between spouses and reducing information
 asymmetries.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Increased attention for the inner workings of the household farm by both
 researchers and practitioners led to innovations in data collection 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 One example is the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), a comprehen
sive and standardized measure to directly measure womenâ€™s empowerment and
 inclusion in the agricultural sector 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "alkire2013women"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The focus on intra-household processes has also substantially increased
 the availability of data that is collected at the individual household
 member level, especially from the co-heads of the households.
 Studies that collect data from male and female co-heads separately find
 that spouses often provide different answers on even the most basic questions.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 demonstrate that while part of the this may be due to measurement error,
 there is also a systematic component that reflects asymmetric information
 within households where one co-head does not have accurate knowledge about
 the decisions made, actions taken, or assets owned of the other.
 Furthermore, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"

\end_inset

 argue that the fact that spousal disagreement in reporting is larger for
 assets that can be hidden more easily than for others suggests that, to
 some extent, spouses exploit these information asymmetries by deliberately
 hiding assets and decisions from each other.
 A number of lab-in-the-field experiments indeed confirm that household
 members conceal resources from one another

\begin_layout Standard
We contribute to this line of research by documenting spousal disagreement
 in reported behaviour among a large sample of semi-subsistance maize farming
 household in Uganda.
 First, on a range of decisions that are crucial to increase yields such
 as timely planting, seed spacing and weeding, we ask both spouses to indicate
 who made each decision on each plot.
 Spouses can indicate they took the decision alone, that their spouse took
 the decision alone, or that the decision was taken jointly.
 These answers are then combined to assess the degree of disagreement in
 decision making.
 Second, we ask each spouse separately how much time he or she spent on
 each of five important maize farming related activities (land preparation,
 planting, weeding, spraying, and harvesting) on each plot and also to provide
 an estimate of how much time his or her spouse spent on these activities.
 We combine these answers to construct a measure of shirking, where one
 spouse devotes less time on a particular activity than his or her spouse
 thinks.
 Finally, we ask each spouse how much maize he of she sold unilaterally
 (as opposed to joint sales) and also ask each spouse to provide an estimate
 of how much his or her spouses sold alone.
 In addition to estimating quantities, we also inquire about how much income
 was derived from this transaction.
 We again combine this information to reflect income hiding, where one spouse
 reports more sales than the other spouse is aware of.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to documenting patterns in spousal disagreement, the paper also
 tests two simple interventions aimed at reducing disagreement related to
 decision making, shirking and income hiding.
 Inspired by recent research on behavioral change communication and social
 marketing, a first intervention consists of a video treatment that promotes
 a mental model of farming as a joint venture, with both spouses having
 an equal role in decision making, activities, and rewards.
 A second intervention focuses more on reducing information asymmetry between
 spouses.
 By making sure both spouses have similar information about what decision
 need to be made, what labour is required and what yields can be expected,
 spouses are expected to be better able to monitor each other and provide
 better estimates of each other's efforts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find substantial disagreement between spouses.
 We find some indications that couple role models reduce the likelihood
 that men disagree that women were involved, while reducing information
 asymmetry reduces the likelihood that women disagree that men were involved.
 Reducing information asymmetry reduces male shirking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The next section presents
 the research questions, the interventions we use to test the research hypothese
s, and the underlying theory of change.
 We then present the experimental design and test pre-treatment balance
 between the different treatment groups on a range of household characteristics.
 We then turn to the results, first looking at how the interventions affect
 joint decision making.
 We then test if increasing cooperation also leads to a more equitable distribut
ion of labor.
 As changes in aspirations have been found to affect forward looking behavior
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bernard2014future"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, we also look at the impact of the interventions on intentions to invest
 proceeds from maize farming.
 We then explore household level outcomes.
 A next section explores spousal disagreement and we also report effects
 on the likelihood that farmers tell each other in the event of disagreement.
 A final section concludes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Literature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we review related literature.
 We mainly focus on the empirical empowerment literature.
 A number of studies investigate whether disagreement in responses of spouses
 on the same question means something, or if this should just be discounted
 as noise.
 Generally, studies find that response differences are significant and systemati
c.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One particularly insightful study that tries to separate signal from noise
 is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 They develop a conceptual model that differentiates between three explanations
 for spousal disagreement.
 First, they note that if disagreement solely derives from measurement error,
 disagreement should be symmetric, and the female co-head's responses should
 not differ differ systematically from the male co-head's responses.
 Secondly, they test for asymmetric measurement error, where men and women
 interpret questions differently.
 In this case, answers may differ systematically between spouses, but disagreeme
nt should be similar for the different questions asked in the survey.
 Finally, they argue that finding differing rates of disagreement across
 survey questions, and higher disagreement for assets and activities that
 are easier to hide in particular, points to asymmetric information.
 Using observational data on decision making and asset ownership in Bangladesh,
 they find that asymmetric information in the form of hidden assets and
 decisions is present in the households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, while most studies on spousal disagreement seem to assume that
 information asymmetry is a sign that individuals hide resources or actions
 from other household members, information asymmetry does not always have
 to be the result of one spouse intentionally deceiving another.
 There may be other systematic biases that manifest more in one asset or
 decision category than others.
 There may be cognitive bias shaped by prevailing gender norms.
 For example, when society sees spraying chemicals as a dangerous activity
 that only men should do, men may exaggerate the resources they allocated
 to this task and the decision power in this sphere.
 Some activities or assets may simply be difficult to get information about
 or to monitor, which does not necessarily mean that one spouse is strategically
 hiding it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 is another powerful illustration of the conceptual and analytical value
 of intra-household contention over decision-making.
 They use disagreement to identify households where women take power (as
 opposed to a more commonly used measure women empowerment where spouses
 agree that the women is involved in decision making).

\begin_layout Subsection
Asymmetric information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if both spouses are provided with information on planting,
 they will also have a better idea of the resources that are needed in this
 activity.
 This may mean that they revise their estimates of the time needed to complete
 the task.
 Furthermore, it may increase the ability and of spouses to monitor each
 other

 In close-knit societies, what individuals can and can not do often depends
 on how others, including one's spouse, judge it.

 More recently, research also started to look into the intra-household dynamics
 that mediate the role that norms play, as the cost of violating norms may
 differ between spouses and/or there may be important externalities

) positively impacted test results of Ugandan school girls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a second hypothesis, we will therefore test whether projecting a household
 cooperative approach to farming leads to better outcomes.
 Also here, we posit different impact pathways.
 First, there may be aspirational effects of seeing a couple farming maize
 successfully together.
 The intervention may also serve to challenge social norms and gender roles
 that prescribe that men specialize in productive and women in reproductive
 activities.
 This may lead women to become more assertive when men take decisions or
 it may make men more open to women participation in farming.

Also here, can we look more into mechanisms? Unfortunately, we threw out
 all questions that attempted to measure aspirations, but maybe we can argue
 that the decision to invest in agriculture is indicative of an aspirational
 effect?
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farming happens in a particular cultural context, and social norms may hamper
 efficient allocation of production factors.
 For instance, in patrilineal societies it may be that only men are assumed
 to make decisions on certain crops, or only women are allowed to carry
 out certain activities.
 However, norms and customs can change, and role models have been found
 to be important catalysts

 We therefore devise an intervention aimed at promoting a cooperative approach
 to farming.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study involved a among a random sample of maize farmers in southwestern
 Uganda.
 Two-stage cluster sampling was used to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, from five districts (Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo,
 and Namutumba), we first selected 50 parishes randomly and in proportion
 to the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all the households, from which we sampled
 10 households to be included in the study.
 This resulted in a total sample size of 3,280 households.
 However, to investigate cooperation within the household, we only use household
s where we managed to interview both spouses separately, which was the case
 in 2,548 households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intervention was only implemented on a subset of the data.
 In 261 households, a video was shown where a couple is depicted, while
 in 475 households, a video was shown where the recommended practices were
 illustrated by a man or a woman alone.

 reports orthogonality tests for experiments.
 The first column reports sample means (and standard deviations in parentheses
 below) for the variables indicated to the left, measured at baseline (baseline
 data was collected in August 2017).
 For instance, we found that at the time of baseline data collection, average
 yields in the sample amounted to about 264 kg per acre
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is a very low yield; during focus group discussions, we learned that
 yields are normally about 500 to 700 kg per acre.
 The low yield is most likely a result of adverse weather shocks and the
 fall armyworm outbreak during the first season of 2017.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Average age of the household head in our sample is 40 years and only about
 36 percent reported to have finished primary education.
 The average household has more than 7 members who live in a house with
 2.2 bedrooms.
 Only 11 percent had access to agricultural extension in the preceding year,
 about 20 percent used (inorganic) fertilizer and almost 40 percent reported
 to have used improved seed.
 Average distance to the nearest agro-input dealer is 5.5 km and almost 80
 percent of households own a mobile phone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second column, we report differences in means at baseline between
 households that received the extension information as a couple and households
 where only one of the spouses (either the husband of the wife) received
 the information.
 We find significant imbalance on various baseline characteristics for this
 first treatment.
 For instance, we see that in the sub-sample of households that were given
 the information as a couple, the household head is almost 4 years older
 than in households where the information was given to only one of the spouses.
 Household heads in households that were treated as a couple are also significan
tly more likely to have finished primary education.
 We further find that these households are about 10 percentage points more
 likely to own a mobile phone and 5 percentage points less likely to have
 used fertilizer.
 We also have some indications that access to extension and households size
 is correlated with the treatment.
 A test for joint orthogonality also indicates that there are significant
 differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups.
 The third column of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance_treat1"

\end_inset

 compares households where a video was shown featuring a couple role model
 to households that got to see a video in which a male maize farmer did
 all the acting.
 For this treatment, we find balance among almost all baseline characteristics.
 We also can not reject joint orthogonality.

Both experiments are implemented using short videos that were shown to farmers
 on tablet computers.
 The videos were designed with a dual purpose in mind.
 First, the videos serve to transfer knowledge about recommended agronomic
 management practices and the use of modern technologies.
 It is shown how fields need to be prepared using organic fertilizer.
 Proper seed spacing and seeding rates and it importance are explained.
 furthermore, it is shown in detail how inorganic fertilizer needs to be
 applied and in what quantities.
 Furthermore, attention is devoted to identifying striga, a parasitic weed
 that affects maize yields in the area.
 We also devote ample attention to the importance of seed quality and recommend
 using hybrid seed or Open Pollinated Varieties (OPV).
 Other recommended practices include timely planting and weeding.
 Second, the information was packaged as an inspirational story of poor
 farmers that, over time, are able to break out of a poverty trap.
 The video starts with a farmer explaining that he used to struggle with
 low yields, producing barely enough food to feed his family, but that over
 the years, he learned how to increase the number of bags of maize produced
 on his maize plots.
 It is shown how the farmer starts using recommended practices on a small
 part of his land.
 It is also shown how he sells a chicken and borrows some money from a neighbor
 to buy improved seed and fertilizer.
 The return on this initial investment is then re-invested, and the viewer
 is taken through some basic inter-temporal cost-benefit calculations.
 The video ends by showing a happy farmer that assures the viewer that he
 or she can also become a successful farmer by following his example.

 the couple (husband and wife together) is shown a video to outcomes of
 households in which with only one co-head of the household (husband or
 wife) is shown the video.
 To answer the second research questionâ€“whether promoting a household cooperativ
e approach to farming is effectiveâ€“we compare outcomes of households where
 an aspirational video was shown in which a man and woman participate as
 equals on the family farm and deliver the message as a couple to outcomes
 of households where where an aspirational video was shown featuring only
 a man.

In this section,we start by exploring patterns of decision making related
 to maize growing within the household.
 We asked the head of the household to list all maize plots that the household
 was cultivating during the season preceding the survey, which was the second
 agricultural seasons of 2018.
 We then cycle through the different plots and repeat a series of questions
 for each plot.
 The same questions were asked separately to each co-head.
 We asked, for a range of key decisions that need to be made and that are
 known to significantly affect maize yields, who made the decision on that
 particular plot.
 Respondents could answer that decisions were made by the person that was
 interviewed alone; by the spouse of the person interviewed alone; by the
 person interviewed and his or her spouse jointly; by someone else inside
 or outside the household; by the person interviewed together with someone
 else inside or outside the household; or by the spouse jointly with someone
 else inside or outside the household.
 Respondents could also indicate that they did not know who made the decision.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by looking at the responses given by the male co-heads within the
 household (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision-making"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The first decision we consider was simply who decided maize should be planted
 on the particular plot.
 A second decision is related to timing of planting.
 Timely planting of maize is very important for subsequent maize yields.
 Maize planting should start immediately after the first rains of the season,
 resulting in significant time pressure when large areas need to be planted.
 A third important decision that maize farmers have to make is related to
 the spacing of seed and seed rate.
 There is a wide range of seed methods used by farmers.
 Some simply broadcast the seeds.
 However, row planting leads to significantly higher yields as plants have
 optimal space to obtain sufficient sun and nutrients.
 Farmers also often plant more than one seed per hill, because they fear
 some seeds may not geminate.
 However, planting more than one seed per hill may also increase competition
 for light and nutrients, leading to stunted growth.
 It is therefore recommended to use only one seed per hill and engage in
 gap filling when seeds do not germinate after one week.
 We also asked who made decisions related to weed control.
 For weeding, we differentiate between decision making related to strategies
 used to combat striga infestations and weeding more general.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Joint-decision-making"

\end_inset

 shows that, at least according to the male co-head, joint decision making
 is the norm.
 For example, on the 3,723 maize plots on which data was collected, men
 indicate that on 1,947 plots the decision to start planting maize was taken
 together with the wife.
 This corresponds to about 52 percent of plots.
 The pattern seems to be rather consistent across the different decision
 spheres.
 For the decision on how to fight striga, the percentage drops to 42 percent,
 but this is due to the fact that part of the plots, striga was not a problem
 and so no decision needed to be made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure also shows that on one out of three plots, the male co-head states
 that decisions are made by him alone, without consulting his wife.
 Also here, the percentages remain stable across the decision makings spheres,
 with a slightly higher incidence of male co-head unilateral decision making
 on spacing and slightly less unilateral male decision making on weeding.
 Finally, the figure also shows that, according to men, women decide to
 plant maize without consulting their husband on 414 out of the total 3,723
 plots, corresponding to about 11 percent.
 This share is also stable over the five decision spheres considered in
 the figure, with slightly more decisions taken by women on weeding and
 slight less on seed spacing.

, but now shows responses as provided by the female co-head.
 Also here, we see that women report that decisions are generally made jointly:
 on the 3,723 maize plots in the sample, the woman co-head indicates that
 on 1,892 plots the decision to start planting maize was taken by the male
 and female co-head together.
 Also for the other decisions, on about half of all plots women say the
 decision was made jointly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Women also report that it is more common that men take decisions alone than
 that women take decisions alone.
 For instance, women report that on 1,015 out of the 3,723 maize plots,
 man took the decision to start planting without consulting anyone else.
 However, there is less consistency over the different decision spheres.
 Men are relatively less likely to unilaterally decide on weeding related
 activities.
 Finally, women report that they make decisions unilaterally on about 15
 percent of the plots.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 suggest some degree of disagreement between spouses.
 For instance, while male co-heads indicated that they alone took the decision
 to plant maize on about 32 percent of the plots, women say that man unilaterall
y took the decision to plant maize on only 27 percent of the plots.
 At the same time, female co-heads say they alone decided to plant maize
 on 16 percent of the plots.
 Men indicate that women unilaterally decided to plant maize on only 11
 percent of the plots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate this disagreement further, we construct two indices based
 on answers of both spouses.
 In particular, we follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and define plots on which female co-head take power.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows that on about 11 percent of all plots, the male co-head thinks he
 was involved in the decision to plant maize on the plot, while women claim
 they made the decision alone.
 At the same time, we see that on about 17 percent of all plots, the female
 co-head thinks she was involved in the decision to plant maize, but the
 male co-head indicates he made the decision alone.

 shows that among household where a video was shown where one individual
 provided the information (the control group), on about 10 percent of the
 plots the female co-head says she took the decision to plant maize alone
 while the male co-head thinks he was involved in this decision

, but now in the smaller sample of households included in our experiment.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The second column shows the average treatment effect of the treatment and
 reveals that there is no effect of the treatment on this outcome.
 This comparison between those who saw the couple video and those who saw
 a video with a single actor is repeated for all five decision spheres.
 We do find a significant impact of the intervention on the the likelihood
 that women disagree that the man was involved in decisions related to weeding.
 Here we see that among households where the video was shown with a single
 actor providing all the information, women say they took the decision related
 to weeding alone while men think they were involved on 12.5 percent of plots.
 Among households that were exposed to the video the features a couple,
 this type of disagreement occurs on only 8.4 percent of plots.

In the third column, we report control group means for the share of plots
 on which women claim they were involved in decision making but men say
 they took the decision unilaterally.
 Again in line with Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision"

\end_inset

, we see for instance that this type of disagreement on when to plant maize
 applies to about 18 percent of the plots.
 The fourth column shows that disagreement on the timing reduced by 6.3 percentag
e points among households that received the couple role model treatment.
 We also see a significant reduction in men disagreeing that women were
 involved in decisions related to spacing of maize seed.
 More generally, for the couple role model treatment, while not all coefficients
 are statistically significant, they are all negative, indicating that the
 treatment reduced disagreement with respect to decision making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next turn to the second treatment and compare disagreement on decision
 making between co-heads in households where only one co-head viewed the
 video and households where the video was shown to both co-heads.
 Column 5 of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:decisions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 show that in households where only one of the co-heads was exposed to the
 video, the female co-head said she decided to plant maize alone while the
 male co-head thought he was involved in this decision on about 13 percent
 of the plots.
 Column 6 indicates that this percentage was 3.1 percentage points lower
 among households where both spouses was shown the video, although the reduction
 in disagreement is not statistically different from zero.
 We do, however, find significant reductions in this type of disagreement
 for decisions related to spacing and weeding among households where both
 spouses were treated with the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the last two columns, we look at the impact of providing both spouses
 with the same information on the likelihood that the male co-head says
 he took the decision alone while the female co-head thinks she was involved.
 Control group means are again in close to what we find in the entire sample
 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 We find again that disagreement reduced somewhat as a result of targeting
 both spouses with information, but only for decisions relate to the timing
 of planting and the difference is only significant at the 10 percent significan
t level.
 However, also for this treatment, all but one of the coefficients are estimated
 negative, suggesting that overall, targeting the couple with information
 instead on only one co-head reduced disagreement with respect to decision
 making in agriculture.

\begin_layout Standard
We also collected detailed information on labour.
 On each maize plot, we ask each co-head how much time, expressed in labour
 days, he or she worked on a particular activity.
 We also ask each co-head to give an estimate of how much time his or her
 spouse worked on the plot on that particular task.
 The activities we inquired about are land preparation, planting, weeding,
 spraying and harvesting.
 Weeding happens at three different times, but is aggregated into one measure
 for this analysis.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-spent-man"

 shows time spent on different activities as reported by the male co-head.
 We see that the male co-head spends about 8 days preparing the plot, 2
 days planting, almost 15 days weeding, one day of spraying and another
 2 days harvesting.
 The figure also shows that the male co-head reports that his wife spends
 one day less in preparing the land and also half a day less in weeding.
 Men think women almost never engage in spraying of insecticides, herbicides
 or fungicides.
 The average male co-head in our sample thus reports to work about 28 days
 on the average plot over the entire agricultural season.
 He reports that women work about 26 days on that plot over the entire season.

, but now as reported by the female co-head within the household.
 Interestingly, while male co-heads think they spent more time on all activities
, female co-heads are also of the opinion that they work harder than men
 on all activities, the only exception being spraying.
 Female co-heads claim they work on average about 7 to 8 days on field preparati
on on a plot, while they think the male co-head only work 6 days.
 Female co-heads also indicate that they spend 16.5 days on weeding, while
 men spend only 13.5 days on that activity.
 Male and female co-heads spend about the same time on planting and harvesting.
 Only for spraying, they agree that the male co-head provides most of the
 work.
 According to the female co-head, she works almost 30 days, while the male
 co-head works about 25 days over the entire season.

 again suggests substantial disagreement between spouses on time worked.
 For instance, we see that male co-heads report that they work on average
 about 8 days to prepare the land, yet women indicate that men only work
 6 days to prepare the land.
 Women on the other hand report that they work on average 16 days on the
 field to weed, while men think that women only work 14 days on the field
 for weeding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While on average, spouses tend to overestimate their own labour and underestimat
e their spouses labour, there is also a substantial part of the sample where
 a co-head reports to work less than what the other thinks.
 We will refer to this type of disagreement in labour reported as shirking.
 For the analysis, we define shirking as a simple binary event where a male
 co-head shirks on a particular activity if he reports he worked fewer hours
 than his wife thinks.
 A female co-head shirks if she works less than the male co-head thinks.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 shows shirking by spouses.
 For example, we find that on about 30 percent of the plots, the male co-head
 spends less time preparing the land than the female co-head thinks he does.
 For the task of preparing the land, women shirk slightly more.
 However, in general, the figure indicates male co-heads shirk more than
 female co-heads.
 Shirking is highest for men when it comes to weeding: On 40 percent of
 the plots, male co-heads put in less time than their female co-head thinks
 he does.

Income hiding

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at maize sales.
 Also here, we asked each spouse separately how much maize was sold from
 the season under consideration.
 In particular, we asked each of the spouses separately to estimate how
 much was sold by (1) him or her, (2) by his or her spouse, and (3) jointly

 We also asked them to indicate the revenue that was derived from these
 sales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Men report that households sold on average 1.4 bags of maize as a couple

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A typical bag contains about 120 kilograms of maize.

.
 Women report that they sold just under one bag as a household.
 Averaged over the entire sample, joint sales amounted to about 23 dollars,
 at least as reported by the male co-head.
 Women estimated this amount much lower at 13 dollars.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As this paper is more about spousals disagreement, we focus on unilateral
 sales as reported by both spouses.
 Figure

 shows in the left panel that men reported they sold half a bag themselves.
 Women reported that the male co-head only sold 0.25 bags of maize.
 This may indicate that the average male co-head in our sample sold about
 one quarter of a bag behind the female co-head's back.
 Women, on the other hand, report that they sold only about 12 kilograms
 of maize alone.
 Men think that the female co-head unilaterally sold about 6 kilograms.
 As such, in percentage terms, quantities hidden is similar between male
 and female co-heads.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The right panel of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Maize-sales"

\end_inset

 looks at income derived from these sales.
 Male co-heads indicate that they received about 7.6 dollars on average from
 their unilateral sales of maize.
 Women estimate this revenue to be only about 2 dollar.
 The fact that the gap between what men report and what women report has
 increased dramatically may indicate that men also hide income by reporting
 to the female co-head lower prices than what they actually received for
 the maize.
 This seems to be less the case for women, where differences in male and
 female reported revenues are in line with differences in quantities sold.

As in previous sections, we look at the impact of the two interventions
 on disagreement related to maize sales.
 We conjecture that encouraging cooperation and reducing information asymmetries
 between spouses may lead to a reduction in income hiding.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:income_hiding"

\end_inset

 reports results for three outcomes.
 A first outcome is a simple binary indicator that takes the value of one
 if a spouse appears to engage in concealing sales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first row in the table shows that among households that were shown a
 video with only one actor, about 14 percent of male co-heads sold more
 than what the female co-head thought.
 In this same subset, about 6 percent of female co-heads sold more than
 what the male co-head thought the female co-head sold.
 We do not find that these rates are significantly different among households
 that were given the couple role model treatment video.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, the right panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:income_hiding"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 reports result for the second treatment.
 It shows that there is also no impact of providing both spouses with the
 same information on the likelihood that spouses engage in income hiding.
 We further consider quantities hidden in rows 3 and 4 of the table, and
 translate this into income obtained from selling these quantities in rows
 5 and 6.
 Overall, we do not find that our interventions affect disagreement related
 to maize sales.

When spouses choose to exploit their information advantages by hiding income,
 they must allocate resources away from goods that can easily be monitored,
 which can result in underinvestment in household goods.
 Child human capital investments, such as education and nutrition, tend
 to be easily monitored.
 These investments have important spillover effects in a householdâ€™s ability
 to step out of poverty because they increase child productivity later in
 life, providing further sources of income diversification to the household
 (Duflo 2001; Rosenzweig 1990).
 Further, household surveys where expenditure and income of the entire household
 is reported by one spouse are commonly used for poverty measurement.
 However, when imperfect information flows exist between household members
 over resources, reporting of expenditures other than oneâ€™s own is unreliable.
