Bragging, Shirking, and Hiding: Spousal Disagreement among Ugandan Maize
 Farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To gain a better understanding of intrahousehold bargaining processes, surveys
 increasingly collect data from co-heads individually.
 Answers provided by spouses on the same set of questions often differ substanti
ally, alternately attributed to measurement error, poor framing within the
 cultural context that leads to systematic biases, or other common challenges
 associated with surveys.
 However, recent studies suggest that differences in responses from co-heads
 may also be caused by spouses strategically hiding information from each
 other.
 Using detailed data on a large sample of monogamous smallholder maize-farming
 households in eastern Uganda, we document response patterns from household
 co-heads related to decision-making, labor time, and sales of farm output.
 We ask each spouse questions about themselves, but also about their spouse,
 and compare responses.
 We also implement two interventions to test if such spousal disagreement
 in reporting can be reduced by increasing cooperation between spouses and
 reducing information asymmetries.
 We conclude that discord in response patterns between spouses is only partly
 explained by spouses deliberately withholding information from each other;
 spousal disagreement in survey response should also be attributed to role
 congruity, where spouses provide answers that are in line with gendered
 norms and customs in society.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Increased attention to the internal dynamics of agricultural households
 by both researchers and practitioners has led to various innovations in
 data collection

\end_inset

.
 Examples of best practice in data collection on intrahousehold decision-making
 processes include separate interviewing of male and female co-heads of
 the household using distinct survey instruments that may nonetheless contain
 common topics and questions.
 Although the choice of respondents may miss out on other dimensions of
 intrahousehold gender relations – between mothers and daughters-in-laws,
 or between co-wives in polygynous households, for example – studies using
 these instruments often find that spouses provide different answers on
 even the most basic questions

 demonstrate that while part of these divergent responses may be attributable
 to measurement error, there is also a systematic component that reflects
 asymmetric information within households where one co-head does not have
 accurate knowledge about the decisions made, actions taken, or assets owned
 by the other.
 Furthermore, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"

\end_inset

 find that spousal disagreement in reporting is larger for assets that can
 be hidden more easily than other types of assets, suggesting that, to some
 extent, spouses exploit these information asymmetries by deliberately hiding
 information, assets, and decisions from each other.
 A number of lab-in-the-field experiments similarly confirm that, in many
 cases, household members conceal some of their resources from one another

\begin_layout Standard
We contribute to this line of research by documenting spousal disagreement
 in reported behavior among a large sample of semi-subsistence monogamous
 maize-farming households in Uganda.
 First, on a range of decisions that are crucial to increasing maize yields
 such as timely planting, seed spacing, and weeding, we ask both spouses
 separately to indicate who made each of these decisions on each plot on
 the household's farm.
 Spouses are given the option to indicate whether they took the decision
 alone, whether their spouse took the decision alone, or whether the decision
 was taken jointly.
 These answers are then combined to assess the extent and direction of disagreem
ent with respect to decision-making.
 Second, we ask each spouse separately how much time he or she spent on
 five different important maize farming-related activities – land preparation,
 planting, weeding, spraying, and harvesting – on each plot.
 We also ask each co-head to provide an estimate of how much time his or
 her spouse spent on these same activities.
 We similarly combine these answers to assess the extent and direction of
 disagreement with respect to labor time allocation.
 Finally, we ask each co-head how much maize was sold jointly with his or
 her spouse, how much maize he or she sold unilaterally (as opposed to selling
 through joint sales), and how much maize was sold by his or her spouse
 unilaterally, as well how much money was obtained through the sale.
 These answers are again combined to assess the extent and direction of
 disagreement with respect to maize marketing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We make a further contribution by testing the impact of two interventions
 on spousal disagreement in these same households.
 Inspired by recent research on behavioral change communication and social
 marketing, the first intervention consists of a treatment that promotes
 a mental image of maize farming as a cooperative or joint venture in which
 both spouses play an equal role in decision-making, farming activities,
 and rewards.
 The second intervention aims to reduce intrahousehold information asymmetries
 between spouses with regard to good maize-farming practices.
 Both interventions aim to influence intrahousehold gender relations in
 a slightly different way – one by a behavioral nudge and one with an informatio
n treatment – to affect change not only in co-heads' approach to decision-making
 on cultivation and management practices, timing, labor time allocations,
 and yield expectations, but also in how co-heads monitor each other and
 estimate each other's efforts and returns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find substantial disagreement between spouses.
 For instance, we find that co-heads exaggerate their own decision-making
 power on almost one in four plots.
 However, we also find that promoting a cooperative approach to maize farming
 reduces the likelihood that co-heads overestimate their own influence on
 decision-making.
 We find similar effects from reducing information asymmetries between spouses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For labor, we find that co-heads seem to overstate their own labor contribution
 to the farm relative to their spouse's contribution.
 Conversely, we also find a substantial share of co-heads report that they
 work less than what the other spouse thinks.
 We further observe that, to some extent, a reduction in information asymmetries
 between spouses tends to reduce the likelihood that a co-head overstates
 his or her own labor contribution, indicating an increase in monitoring
 capacity within the household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we find that spouses tend to overstate own sales in the marketing
 of maize produced on the farm.
 However, the cooperative image intervention reduces the likelihood and
 degree of one spouse reporting lower sales than what the other spouse reported.

\begin_layout Section
Literature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our review of prior work on spousal disagreement focuses mainly on the empirical
 literature on intrahousehold resource allocation and decision-making in
 agricultural households in developing countries, and draws primarily on
 analyses that use observational data from surveys in which both spouses
 are interviewed separately and are asked the same set of questions.
 Such studies often focus on research questions related to women's empowerment
 and autonomy.
 For example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1728-4465.2002.00299.x"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 asks both spouses questions on the locus of decision-making on a variety
 of issues, as well as specific questions concerning women's mobility and
 access to resources.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 collect data from both spouses on a range of autonomy items, including
 the need of the wife to obtain the husband's permission to go to different
 types of places, the wife's capacity to decide on their children's affairs,
 whether the wife is allowed to have a job, and her role in deciding on
 the number of children and household expenditure-related decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common finding in studies that ask the same set of questions to different
 individuals within the household is that substantial disagreement often
 arises between spouses, even on questions that would seem easily and objectivel
y verifiable, such as the number of children, or type of material used for
 house construction.
 This divergence may simply be attributable to measurement error by the
 respondents.
 But 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggest that such divergence may also partly be due the fact that the response
 categories do not have the same cognitive or semantic meanings to women
 and men, leading to the somewhat pessimistic conclusion that survey questions
 are of limited use in understanding differences in gender stratification
 across multiple contexts.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, in an investigation of variation in husband and wife perspectives on the
 division of authority over agriculture-related decisions in rural Tanzania,
 goes one step further by concluding that in the absence of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

intrahousehold accords,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it may be problematic for interventions informed by the analysis of survey
 data to reduce gender inequalities or empower women in agricultural households.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "SEYMOUR201897"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 note that spouses often give inconsistent answers when asked about who
 made a particular decision.
 They then test whether female unilateral decision-making is equally empowering
 if the male co-head disagrees that the woman took the decision alone, as
 compared to when the male co-head agrees.
 They conclude that disagreement may signal underlying power dynamics within
 the household that are likely to be relevant when assessing individual-level
 agency and empowerment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 provide a particularly insightful conceptual framework that teases out
 the various perspectives on spousal disagreement.
 First, they note that if disagreement solely derives from measurement error,
 disagreement should be symmetric, and the female co-head's responses should
 not differ systematically from the male co-head's responses.
 Second, they point out that if disagreement results from asymmetric measurement
 error in which men and women interpret questions differently, then answers
 should differ systematically between spouses, but disagreement should be
 similar for different questions asked in a survey.
 Finally, they argue that finding differing rates of disagreement across
 survey questions, and higher rates of disagreement for assets and activities
 that are easier to hide in particular, points to the presence of intrahousehold
 information asymmetries.
 Using observational data collected in Bangladesh, they find evidence that
 such information asymmetries in the form of hidden assets and decisions
 are present in their sampled households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This should not be interpreted to mean that information asymmetries always
 reflect the act of one spouse intentionally deceiving another.
 There may be other systematic biases that manifest more in one asset or
 decision category than others, and that may be shaped by prevailing gender
 roles and norms.
 For example, in a case study in northern Uganda, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that men often report unilateral decision-making in areas where they
 are assumed to bear final responsibility, even if women had some degree
 of involvement.
 Women tend to view these scenarios as joint decisions.
 As such, it is important to understand the local cultural context to differenti
ate spousal disagreement as a function of information asymmetries stemming
 from intentional hiding versus other gender-related systematic biases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANNAN2021105292"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 offer another illustration of the conceptual and analytical value of intrahouse
hold contention over decision-making.
 They argue that assessing agency and empowerment requires that disagreement
 be considered not by its presence or absence, but also in terms of its
 direction.
 Specifically, they differentiate cases in which male co-heads disagree
 with their spouse claiming to be involved in decision-making from cases
 where male co-heads disagree with their spouse claiming not to be involved
 in decision-making.
 The former is interpreted as women 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

taking power
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, while the latter is interpreted as women 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being given power
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While most studies focus on disagreement with respect to decision-making,
 divergent responses on income streams and asset ownership are also commonly
 observed in household data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "for example, "
key "twyman2015gendered"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 As such, instead of simply recording whether an asset is owned by a spouse
 using a yes/no question, some studies go further and try to place values
 on incomes and assets.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "castilla2012ties"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 uses the male co-head's own reporting of his own farm income and compares
 this to the female co-head’s reporting of her husband's farm income to
 identify income hiding by men, and finds that female co-heads' estimate
 of farm income is on average 14 percent lower than what male co-heads report.
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "FISHER2010966"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that in 66 percent of the Malawian households they studied, the male
 co-head understated his wife’s income by an average of 47 percent of what
 the female co-head reported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While most of the studies noted above explore patterns in spousal disagreement,
 other studies extend the line of inquiry to examine correlations with welfare
 outcomes of households, women, and children 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ANNAN2021105292,doi:10.1086/703082,SEYMOUR201897"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 The emerging consensus is that spousal disagreement is closely correlated
 with – and likely causally linked to – a wide range of welfare outcomes.
 Following from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANNAN2021105292"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we attempt to fill a gap in the literature that attempts to better understand
 these causal pathways and to explore interventions that might change intrahouse
hold dynamics via a reduction in spousal disagreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Experimental design and interventions
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The emerging literature on spousal disagreement in survey response suggests
 at least two underlying mechanisms.
 First, spousal disagreement may reflect different cognitive understanding
 of the responses categories in a survey questionnaire and what the appropriate
 response should be 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This problem is compounded by the cultural context in which these questions
 are asked and answered 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A first treatment therefore attempts to challenge preconceived ideas of
 what decision-making of a spouse involves and who is expected to make decisions
 in a farm household by promoting a cooperative approach to maize farming,
 in which maize cultivation and management activities are seen as a joint
 responsibility of spouses.
 Second, the literature also suggests that spousal disagreement reflects
 information asymmetries between spouses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A second intervention tests if these asymmetries can be influenced by providing
 spouses equal access to information about best practices in maize farming
 prior to the point in time when decisions are made on cultivation and managemen
t.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the heart of both interventions is a short video that is shown twice
 to individuals within households using tablet computers.
 The aim of the video is to increase viewers' knowledge of recommended practices
 in maize farming, such as timely planting, row planting, and the use of
 improved inputs such hybrid seed and inorganic fertilizer.
 It does this through an aspirational story in which a farmer (or farmers)
 recounts how he/she/they used to be poor but managed to increase yields
 over time by applying a set of techniques and inputs.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The techniques and inputs that are demonstrated in the videos are the ones
 recommended by the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) and
 are also used by the public agricultural advisory system.
 More details can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "https://doi.org/10.1002/ajae.12089"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 It also suggests that farmers view maize farming as a business that needs
 continuous investment over time and includes some simple intertemporal
 cost-benefit calculations to illustrate this, followed by encouragements
 to follow the example of the model farmer(s) featured in the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first intervention involves varying the actors featured in the video
 and randomizing which version of the video is viewed by farmers.
 The second intervention randomly varies the member(s) of the household
 who view the video.
 These variations and the rationale behind them are explained below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin with a conceptual explanation that ties to our first intervention:
 projecting a cooperative way of farming as a household.
 Consider that within households, individual members often have differing
 spheres of influence reflecting prevailing gender roles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lundberg1993separate"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In many agricultural households, though certainly not all, women tend to
 have a stronger voice in the cultivation of crops that are predominately
 cultivated for home consumption, while men have a stronger voice in the
 cultivation of crops that are marketed.
 Gendered differences in crop choices may emerge from a variety of factors,
 including gender-related differences in knowledge about the crop, access
 to planting material, access to inputs and extension services, and customs
 and traditions

key "NORDHAGEN2021105134,doi:10.1177/0030727019831704"

\end_inset

.
 While the existence of such gendered patterns are widely acknowledged,
 they are not always easily captured in household survey data, as gender
 is only one of the determinants of crop portfolio choice

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Uganda, maize, which is in a part a cash crop, is considered to be mostly
 in the influence sphere of men.
 Generally, men make all important decisions such as what plots to plant
 maize on, how to prepare the land, when to start planting, and what seeds
 to use.
 Men also generally decide on how much labor is needed, while women assist
 men, often with weeding.
 While these are broad and stylized characterizations of Uganda's maize
 production system, their widespread acceptance as conventional wisdom makes
 maize farming a topic ripe for this study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specifically, we expect that such a separation in spheres of influence between
 male and female co-heads may contribute to spousal disagreement in survey
 response.
 Therefore, our first intervention randomly varies which version of our
 video is screened to our study participants.
 One version features a male-female couple who present themselves as role
 models to promote a worldview where both spouses participate equally in
 maize farming, while another version features only a male actor.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A third version of the video features only a female actor, but is not used
 in this intervention.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This approach capitalizes on recent evidence on the influence that role
 models can have on aspirations, investment choices, and other future-oriented
 behaviors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and on increasing women's participation in otherwise male-dominated sectors
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test the hypothesis that spouses disagree less if they view farming as
 a joint spousal activity, we randomly assign 261 households from our sample
 to be shown the cooperative image version of the video, such that both
 the male and female co-heads watch the video together.
 This group functions as the treatment group.
 We also randomly assign 240 households from our sample to be shown the
 version of the video featuring only a male actor, again with both the male
 and female co-heads watching together.
 Because the only difference between the two videos is the composition of
 the actors featured (a male-female couple versus a male actor), any difference
 in outcomes between the two groups should be attributed to the role model
 effect of the cooperative image intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we turn to our second hypothesis that relates to asymmetric information
 within the household.
 Consider the farm household as a collection of individuals, each with their
 own preferences, skills, assets, and access to resources.
 In many contexts, the household's existence and the welfare of its members
 depend on their collective capacity to invest in common goods by drawing
 on each individual's skills, assets, and resources.
 As such, households can be considered as informal institutions, and many
 of the problems encountered in common pool resource management and collective
 action, such as free-riding and overextraction of resources, apply to the
 household 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doss2015collective"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way in which collective action problems can be attenuated is through
 increased mutual monitoring.
 For instance, if one co-head can assess the actual time that the other
 co-head spends on land preparation, then the latter is less likely to engage
 in labor shirking.
 Similarly, if a co-head can determine how much the other co-head earns
 from the sale of farm produce, then the latter is less likely to engage
 in income hiding.
 However, for mutual monitoring to work, co-heads require information against
 which to compare information gained through monitoring, since merely observing
 an outcome may be insufficient to determine if a co-head is shirking, hiding,
 or otherwise mismanaging his or her collective obligations to the household.
 Thus, information on exactly what operations land preparation entails or
 on the prevailing market price for farm produce is necessary for effective
 monitoring.
 For instance, it may be difficult for the female co-head to check if her
 spouse overreports time spent preparing the field if she does not have
 a good understanding of what land preparation entails.
 If both spouses have a good understanding of what agricultural management
 entails, they are also in a better position to monitor each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a second treatment, we therefore make sure both co-heads start off with
 symmetric information with respect to recommended agronomic practices for
 maize farming, as this facilitates mutual monitoring.
 To do so, we show the video that showcases recommended practices in maize
 farming to both spouses in a random sample of 261 households.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We show the version of the video that features a couple (male and female
 actor-farmers), that is, the video used in the treatment group of the previous
 intervention.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This group acts as the treatment group.
 In another random sample of 540 households, the control group, the same
 video is shown, but only to one of the two co-heads.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We made sure that in about half of the cases the video was shown to the
 male co-head alone and in the other half of cases to the female co-head

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interventions described above were conducted among monogamous maize-farming
 households in five districts in eastern Uganda, an area known for its maize
 production.
 Our survey of households that participated in the study was deployed with
 a two-stage cluster sampling approach to obtain a representative sample
 of this population.
 Specifically, we first selected 50 parishes randomly and in proportion
 to the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all households, and in each village
 we sampled 10 households to be included in the study.
 This resulted in a total sample size of 3,280 households.
 However, in about 23 percent of the households we were unable to interview
 both spouses separately, resulting in an effective sample of 2,548 households.
 The interventions described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 were implemented in random subsets of this sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We focus on the second maize-growing season of 2017, which runs from about
 August 2017, when fields are prepared, to January 2018, when maize is harvested.
 Treatments were administered twice, once in August 2017 when farmers were
 preparing fields, and one month later during planting time.
 Concurrent with the first treatment administration in 2017, we also collected
 information on household characteristics and on the previous harvest, which
 was the first harvesting season of 2017.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmers in our study area cultivated on average about 1.5 plots of maize.
 Yields during the first season of 2017 were extremely low (about 270 kilograms
 per acre) as a result of a Fall Armyworm outbreak that significantly affected
 the maize crop.
 Baseline data indicate that the average household in our sample consisted
 of 8 individuals.
 Female co-head in these households are on average 35 years old and only
 30 percent have finished primary education.
 Male co-heads are on average 43 years old and 42 percent have finished
 primary education.
 Only 11 percent of households report that they had access to agricultural
 extension in the year prior to the survey.
 Only 17 percent of households used fertilizer on at least one plot, and
 38 percent reported using improved seed bought from a shop or agro-input
 dealer during the last cropping season (April-July 2017).
 About three quarters of households reported owning a mobile phone.

We now turn to an in-depth analysis of the data collected at endline.
 The focus is on spousal disagreement in survey response using own and cross-rep
orting (that is, what one spouse thinks the other spouse would report).
 We start by looking at patterns in decision making about a series of important
 maize cultivation practices.
 We then turn to time use, again disaggregated over a set of important tasks
 in maize cultivation.
 Finally, we look at decisions related to maize marketing.
 Under each heading, we provide a detailed descriptive analysis of disagreement
 based on the entire sample of 2,548 households, and then report on the
 findings from the two treatments in the respective subsamples.

We start by exploring patterns of intrahousehold decision-making related
 to maize farming.
 In our survey, we asked the head of household to list all maize plots that
 the household was cultivating during the season preceding the survey (that
 is, the second agricultural season of 2017).
 We then cycled through the different plots and asked a series of questions
 for each plot, and repeated the same questions separately with the other
 co-head.
 For a range of key decisions that need to be made and that are known to
 significantly affect maize yields, we asked who made the decision on that
 particular plot.
 Respondents could answer that decisions were made by (1) the respondent
 him- or herself alone, (2) the respondent's spouse alone, (3) the respondent
 jointly with his or her spouse, (4) someone else inside or outside the
 respondent's household, (5) the respondent together with someone else inside
 or outside the household, or (6) the respondent's spouse together with
 someone else inside or outside the household.
 Respondents could also indicate that they did not know who made the decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Responses given by the male co-heads are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:decision_male_reporting"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The first decision we consider is simply who decided that maize should
 be planted on the particular plot.
 A second decision is related to timing of planting, recognizing that planting
 date is a strong agronomic determinant of yields.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
NARO recommends that maize planting start immediately after the first rains
 of the season.
 This often results in significant time pressure on household members' labor
 time, especially when large areas need to be planted.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The third decision relates to the spacing of seed and the seeding rate,
 which reflects the fact that row planting at a rate of one seed per mound
 is also a strong determinant of yield.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is a wide range of seed methods used by farmers in Uganda.
 While some simply broadcast seeds, NARO recommends row planting because
 it results in significantly higher yields since it reduces competition
 between plants for sunlight and soil nutrients.
 Farmers also often plant more than one seed per hill because they fear
 some seeds may not germinate.
 However, planting more than one seed per hill also tends to increase competitio
n for light and nutrients, leading to stunted plant growth.
 It is therefore recommended to use only one seed per hill and engage in
 gap filling when seeds do not germinate after one week.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Finally, we consider decisions related to weed control.
 For weeding, we differentiate between decision-making related to strategies
 used to combat striga infestation (a parasitic weed that feeds off the
 roots of the maize plant) and weeding more generally.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows that, at least according to the male co-head, joint decision making
 by spouses is the norm.
 For example, on the 3,723 maize plots on which data were collected, men
 indicate that on 1,947 plots the decision to start planting maize was taken
 together with their wife.
 This corresponds to about 52 percent of plots.
 The pattern seems to be consistent across the different farming decisions:
 for the decision on how to combat striga, the percentage of joint decision-maki
ng stands at only 42 percent, but this is because on some plots in the sample,
 striga was not a problem and thus no decision making was required.
 The figure also shows that on about 33 percent of plots, the male co-head
 reported that decisions are made by him alone, without consulting his wife,
 on most of the decision points described above.
 On just 11 percent of plots do women decide to plant maize and undertake
 other decisions without consulting their husbands, at least according to
 the responses from male co-heads.

 Also here, we see that women reported that decisions are generally made
 jointly: on 51 percent of plots, the woman co-head indicated that the decision
 to start planting maize was taken by the male and female co-head together.
 Similar results are obtained for most other farming decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Women also reported that it is more common for men to take decisions alone
 than for women to take decisions alone.
 For instance, female co-heads reported that on 27 percent of plots, men
 took the decision to start planting alone.
 However, we observe less consistency in this pattern across other farming
 decisions: according to female co-heads, men are relatively less likely
 to unilaterally decide on weeding-related activities.
 Finally, female co-heads reported that they make decisions unilaterally
 on about 15 percent of the plots.

 suggests some degree of spousal discord.
 For instance, while male co-heads indicated that they alone took the decision
 to plant maize on about 32 percent of plots, female co-heads say that men
 unilaterally took the decision to plant maize on only 27 percent of plots.
 At the same time, female co-heads indicated they alone decided to plant
 maize on 16 percent of plots, while male co-heads indicated that women
 unilaterally decided to plant maize on only 11 percent of plots.

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate this disagreement further, we construct measures based on
 answers of both spouses.
 Given the large number of potential response combinations, it is useful
 to collapse responses into a few meaningful categories to reduce noise
 and facilitate analysis.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 define a variable for cases where the wife says that she is involved (alone
 or jointly as part of the couple), but the husband says she is not, and
 a variable for cases where the husband says the wife is involved but she
 reports that she is not.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANNAN2021105292"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 by differentiating disagreement by the relative locus of decision-making,
 and defining disagreement on plots for which co-heads over- or understate
 their own role in decision-making.
 Cases where co-heads place greater weight on the self as the locus of decision-
making, and so tend to overstate their own roles, are indicated in the dark-shad
ed area to the right of the agreement diagonal in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Agreement-matrix"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 These are instances where one co-head claims that decisions are made by
 him or her alone, but the spouse disagrees and claims that she or he took
 the decision alone or was at least involved in the decision.
 Following this definition, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Agreement-matrix"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that for the decision to plant maize on the plot, co-heads overstated
 their own role on 23.3 percent of plots.
 This figure breaks down as follows.
 On 5.3 percent of plots the male or female co-head said he or she made the
 decision to plant maize alone but the other co-head disagreed and claimed
 it is she or he who decided unilaterally.
 On 5.9 percent of plots the male co-head said he was involved in the decision
 jointly with his wife but the female co-head said she took the decision
 alone.
 And on 12.1 percent of plots the female co-head said she was involved in
 the decision jointly with her husband but the male co-head said he took
 the decision alone.
 Overstating thus means that at least one spouse said he or she took the
 decision alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We further define instances where co-heads understate their own role in
 decision-making and the locus of decision-making is placed with the other
 spouse.
 These are cases in the light-shaded area to the left of the diagonal in
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Here, one co-head said his or her spouse decided unilaterally, but the
 spouse disagreed and said the co-head took the decision alone, or was at
 least involved in the decision.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that for the decision to plant maize on the plot, following this
 definition, co-heads understate their own decision power on 17.6 percent
 of the plots in our sample.
 Specifically, on 2.7 percent of plots, the male or female co-head said the
 other co-head made the decision to plant maize alone but the other co-head
 disagreed; on 4.0 percent of plots the male co-head said his wife took the
 decision alone but the female co-head said he was involved in the decision;
 and in 10.9 percent of the cases the female co-head said her husband took
 the decision to plant maize alone, but the male co-head disagreed and claimed
 his wife was involved in the decision.
 Understating thus means that at least one spouse said that the other spouse
 took the decision alone.

 These terms are somewhat one-sided, as such an interpretation rests on

 Especially for weeding (and related, striga weeding) the locus of decision-maki

 The comparison between those who saw the video featuring the couple and
 those who saw the video featuring the male actor is repeated for all five
 decisions.
 We find significant reductions in the likelihood that co-heads overstate
 their own role in decision making as a result of the cooperative household
 farming intervention for decisions on planting and weeding.

For the timing on planting, we see that among households where the video

 In households that were exposed to the couple role model video, the share
 of plots where co-heads overstate their involvement in this decision is
 only 16.9 percent.
 For the decision related to weeding, we see that in the control group,
 overstatement of own influence affects 25.6 percent of the plots, but this

\begin_layout Standard
The third column reports control group means for the share of plots on which
 spouses understate their own decision-making power.
 We see that in the control group, the decision to plant maize is affected
 by this type of disagreement on 13.7 percent of the plots.
 The fourth column shows the difference in this type of disagreement between
 households that received the cooperative imaging treatment and those who
 did not: we do not find that the treatment reduced the likelihood that
 spouses understate their own role in decision-making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next turn to the second treatment, which reduces information asymmetry
 between spouses and compare disagreement on decision-making between co-heads
 in households where only one co-head was shown the video and households
 where the video was shown to both co-heads together.
 We find that the information treatment leads to a significant reduction
 in the likelihood that one spouse assigns him- or herself more decision-making
 power than the other spouse claims/reports.
 Column 5 of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:decisions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that in households where only one of the co-heads was exposed to
 the video, spouses overstated their own influence on the decision to plant
 maize on 23.5 percent of the plots.
 Column 6 indicates that this percentage was 5.0 percentage points lower
 among households where both spouses were shown the video, and this reduction
 is statistically significant (p<0.05).
 We also find that on decisions related to the timing of planting and weeding,
 ensuring spouses start off with the same information leads to a reduction
 in the likelihood that one spouse assigns him- or herself more decision-making
 power than the other spouse claims.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the last two columns, we look at the impact of providing both spouses
 with the same information on the likelihood that one spouse understates
 his or her role in decision-making.
 Control group means, shown in column 7, are again close to what we find
 in the entire sample depicted in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The last column shows that the likelihood that spouses understate their
 own contribution to decision-making reduces as a result of providing both
 spouses with the same information, but the effect is never significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, we conclude that both the treatment projecting cooperative household
 farming and the treatment reducing information asymmetry lead to a significant
 reduction in the likelihood that one spouse assigns him- or herself more
 decision-making power than the other spouse claims.
 Both treatments are therefore effective in reducing the likelihood that
 spouses overstate their own role in decision-making about maize farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Labor time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also collected detailed information on labor time.
 On each maize plot, we asked each co-head how much time, expressed in labor
 days over the entire agricultural season, he or she worked on a particular
 activity.
 We also asked each co-head to give an estimate of how much time his or
 her spouse worked on the plot on that particular task.
 The activities we inquired about are land preparation, planting, weeding,
 spraying, and harvesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results indicate that while male co-heads report high levels of own labor-time
 allocation to farming, they report that their spouses allocate slightly
 less time, especially for several specific activities.
 The average male co-head in our sample reports to work about 28 days on
 the average plot over the entire agricultural season, and reports that
 his wife works about 26 days.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows labor days spent on different activities as reported by the male
 co-head.
 We see that the male co-head reports spending about 8 days preparing the
 plot, 2 days planting, almost 15 days weeding, 1 day spraying, and another
 2 days harvesting.
 The figure also shows that the male co-head reports that his wife spends
 one day less in preparing the land and also one-half day less in weeding.
 Male co-heads think their wife almost never engages in spraying of agrochemical
s.

, but as reported by the female co-head.
 Interestingly, while male co-heads report spending more time on all activities,
 female co-heads also report that 
\shape italic
they
\shape default
 work harder than their spouse on all activities (with the exception of
 spraying agrochemicals).
 According to female co-heads, they work almost 30 days on average, while
 male co-heads are reported to work about 25 days over the entire season.
 Female co-heads report that, on average, they work about 7 to 8 days on
 field preparation, while they report that their male co-head only works
 6 days on field preparation.
 Female co-heads also indicate that they spend 16.5 days on weeding, while
 they report that their spouse spends only 13.5 days on that activity.
 According to female co-heads, male and female co-heads spend about the
 same time on planting and harvesting.
 Only with respect to agrochemical spraying do co-heads agree that the male
 co-heads undertake most of the work.

\end_inset

 again suggests substantial disagreement between spouses on time worked.
 For instance, we see that male co-heads report that they work on average
 about 8 days to prepare the land, yet women indicate that men only work
 6 days to prepare the land.
 Women, on the other hand, report that they work on average 16 days on the
 field to weed, while men think that women only work 14 days on the field
 for weeding.
 And while, on average, spouses seem to relatively overstate their own labor
 and understate their spouses' labor, a substantial share of the sample
 also report that a co-head works less than what the other thinks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To analyze spousal over- and understatement of labor time, we generate an
 indicator similar to the one used for decision-making about farming in
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Decision-making"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, comparing own-reported time of the co-head to the time estimated by the
 other co-head.
 For each activity, we sum the time that the male co-head reported he spent
 on that activity and the time that the female co-head reported she spent
 on the activity, and compare this to the time the male co-head estimated
 his wife spent on this activity plus the time the female co-head estimated
 her husband spent on the activity.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While we could also look at over- and understatement of labor time for the
 male co-head and the female co-head separately, we decided to aggregate
 these measures.
 This is because we are mainly interested in (reducing) disagreement as
 opposed to e.g.
 (increasing) women's empowerment.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We then define two categories (and associated indicator variables for the
 categories): (1) plots on which co-heads overestimated own labor contributions,
 and (2) plots on which co-heads underestimated own labor contributions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results show that on more than one-half of the plots, co-heads overstate
 the labor that was allocated to land preparation (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Shirking"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 At the same time, we find that on 30 percent of these plots, co-heads indicate
 that they actually spent less time on land preparation than their spouse
 reported.
 This means that only on about 15 percent of plots, do co-heads agree on
 the time spent on the activity.
 Further, we find that while co-heads more frequently overstate – rather
 than understate – labor contributions, substantial differences arise depending
 on the activity.
 For instance, with respect to agrochemical spraying, there seems to be
 agreement on almost 60 percent of the plots.
 Higher levels of agreement on planting, spraying, and harvesting are partly
 explained by the fact that fewer hours are reported (see Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-spent-man"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-spent-woman"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) so less scope exists for differences in cross-reporting.
 For spraying in particular, many households report not to spray and so
 both co-heads report zero hours and know their spouse also spent zero hours.
 However, this is only part of the explanation, as disagreement on land
 preparation is similar to disagreement on weeding despite the fact that
 about twice the amount of labor was allocated to weeding than to land preparati
on.
 The gap between over and understatement of labor is also larger for land
 preparation.

Next, we report on the impact of the treatment that promotes a household
 cooperative approach to farming (Table

, left panel) and the treatment that aims to reduce information asymmetry
 (right panel) on the likelihood that co-heads over- or understate their
 own labor contributions, disaggregated by activity.
 As in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:decisions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the first and third columns report control group means for over- and understat
ement of labor contributions for the first treatment.
 Average treatment effects of the first intervention on overstatement of
 own effort (reported in the second column) and on understatement of own
 effort (fourth column) are never significantly different from zero.

 In the fifth column of Table

, we show again control group average rates of overstatement of spousal
 labor contributions.
 In the control group for the information treatment, spouses overstate own
 labor contributions on 59.2 percent of the plots.
 However, as shown in column 6, this percentage is 8.6 percentage points
 lower among couples where, as the treatment, both spouses got to see the
 video, and this difference is significant at the 5 percent level.
 We also find that reducing information asymmetry reduces the likelihood
 that co-heads overstate own labor contributed to harvesting.
 Columns, 7 and 8 respectively report control group means and average treatment
 effects on the likelihood of understating own labor contributions as a
 result of the information treatment.
 Here, the effects are mixed, with significant increases in the likelihood
 that co-heads overstate labor allocated to land preparation and weeding,
 but a significant reduction in the likelihood that co-heads understate
 own labor allocated to spraying.

 most maize marketing occurs jointly, according to our respondents.

 Female co-heads estimate this revenue to be only about US$2.00.
 Finally, female co-heads report that they received US$1.50 from unilateral
 maize sales.
 Male co-heads estimate that their spouses received on average US$0.60 from
 what they sold alone.
 Note that the difference between co-heads' own and cross-reports increases
 when moving from quantities to revenues, indicating not only disagreement
 with respect to quantities sold but also to prices obtained.
 For male co-heads' unilateral sales in particular, men seem to assume significa
ntly higher sales prices than women do.

\begin_layout Standard
As in previous sections, we look at the impact of the two interventions
 on disagreement related to maize sales.
 While spouses tend to overstate own sales, there are instances where spouses
 report having sold less than what the other co-head reports.
 We thus construct indicators of spousal over- and understatement of sales.
 As done above, we do not differentiate between female co-head and male
 co-head over- or underreporting of sales, but rather create an aggregate
 measure that evaluates the difference between male and female co-heads
 own-reported sales and what the other co-head thinks he or she sold.
 We hypothesize that encouraging a cooperative household farming approach
 through the treatment featuring a couple of farmer-actors and reducing
 information asymmetries between spouses through the information treatment
 leads to a reduction in spousal discord related to sales reporting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find an interesting set of mixed results from the treatment that attempts
 to promote a cooperative approach to farming on over- and understatement
 of maize sales.
 The three rows in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:income_hiding"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 correspond to three different outcomes that reflect disagreement in market
 participation.
 The first is a simple binary indicator that takes the value of one if spouses
 indicate they sell more (less) than what the other spouse thinks.
 The second considers actual quantity overstated (understated) by spouses.
 The third row considers disagreement in value reported derived from these
 sales, as Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Maize-sales"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that there may be disagreement about prices received for maize sold
 in addition to quantity sold.

In the first column of the first row, we see that in the control group for
 the cooperative approach treatment, in 15.0 percent of households co-heads
 report that they sold more than what the other spouse thinks.
 The likelihood that co-heads overstate is similar in the treatment group.
 We also find that, as reported in the second row, the average quantity
 overstated is about one-half of bag.
 The second column finds no evidence of significant effect of the first
 treatment as judged by the coefficient of the treatment indicator estimated
 with a Tobit model.
 We also find no impact of the treatment on overstating of revenue (third
 row column 2).

 In the fourth column, we see that the treatment that promotes a cooperative
 approach to farming decreases this type of disagreement by almost 6 percentage

 This treatment effect is also reflected in a reduction in the understatement
 of actual quantities: in households in the treatment group where the video
 was shown to both spouses, the quantity understated reduces by almost 1.5
 bags.
 While the third row also shows a reduction in the value associated with
 the effect, the effect is not statistically different from zero.

\begin_layout Standard
Results set forth above document substantial spousal disagreement in decision
 making about maize farming, labor contribution, and maize marketing.
 They indicate that the likelihood that co-heads in monogamous maize-farming
 households overstate their own role in decision-making can be reduced by
 reducing intrahousehold information asymmetries and, to a lesser extent,
 by promoting intrahousehold cooperation in farming through a role model
 intervention.
 While results were less clear for the over- and understatement of labor
 contributions, results are more encouraging for the information treatment
 than the treatment projecting cooperative household farming.
 For marketing, promoting cooperation in farming within the household reduced
 the likelihood and degree of one co-head reporting lower sales than what
 the other spouse reported.
 In light of these findings, we explore possible mechanisms that might explain
 our observed patterns of spousal disagreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With respect to differences in reporting related to decision-making, in
 societies or cultures with strong gender norms and customs, co-heads may
 tend to overstate their own role in decision-making due to role congruity
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"

\end_inset

.
 This may also indicate that co-heads claim a larger role within the household,
 in effect claiming recognition for responsibilities taken 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ANNAN2021105292"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The case of co-heads understating their own role in decision-making may
 also be consistent with a range of other possible explanations.
 On one hand, cultural factors may again mean that one co-head plays down
 his or her role and discounts own contribution.
 At the other extreme, one could even imagine situations where the locus
 of decision making is shifted to the other, effectively 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

blaming
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 poor decision-making on the other spouse, for example when, in hindsight,
 the decision turned out to be very bad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results from our intervention suggest that cultural factors play an
 important role in disagreement related to decision making.
 The intervention that promotes a cooperative household farming approach
 with couple role models was expected to challenge traditional views in
 a study region and sociocultural context in which men are assumed to take
 responsibility for maize farming.
 Although these effects were not as robust as expected, we nonetheless generate
 some evidence pointing in this direction.
 At the same time, the fact that we also find significant effects from arming
 both co-heads with equal information may mean that increased monitoring
 reduced the likelihood that spouses would take decisions behind each other's
 back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For labor contributions, cultural factors may also result in one spouse
 claiming to do the bulk of the work, while in reality, the work burden
 may be more equally shared.
 However, it may also indicate imbalance within the relationship, in that
 one spouse performs the bulk of the work without being recognized for it.
 This may often be the case with tedious work such as weeding or domestic
 work and household chores.
 Disagreement characterized by one co-head underreporting own labor contribution
s may point to some degree of shirking.
 For example, it may be that the female co-head does not have a clear idea
 of how long it takes to spray a particular plot and the male co-head exploits
 this information asymmetry by making her believe that it took much longer
 than the time it actually took; the time difference may then be used for
 private activities by the male co-head that do not directly contribute
 to the household as a whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results from our intervention show that only the treatment reducing information
 asymmetry had an impact on disagreement related to spouses' labor contributions.
 This suggests that cultural factors defining gender roles may be less important.
 While the effect of facilitating mutual monitoring on shirking (understating
 labor contributions) is not clear, we do see that arming co-heads with
 information reduces the likelihood that co-heads provide more labor than
 they get credit for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen that some studies interpret cases of overreporting related
 to marketing behavior and income derived from farming activities as signs
 that spouses are hiding income from each other 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "castilla2012ties"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this case, we would have expected that especially the information treatment
 would be more effective in reducing disagreement.
 The fact that we only find an impact from the treatment that promotes a
 cooperative approach suggests that disagreement related to sales is more
 likely related to cultural factors relating to gender roles.
 For instance, our findings may be more consistent with a situation where
 a male co-head exaggerates sales to his spouse because he wants to be seen
 as the provider, but after seeing a video where both spouses are equally
 providing for the household, the male co-head reports sales that are more
 in line with what the female co-head thinks the male co-head sold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Household surveys that are serious about capturing gender-related heterogeneity
 often try to interview both male and female co-heads separately for at
 least part of the survey.
 This is an important means of reducing biases introduced by the (typically
 male) household head or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

most knowledgeable person
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the household, and represents an important advancement in the study
 of intrahousehold dynamics, especially in non-separable agricultural households
 where production and consumption decisions are so closely intertwined.
 A common finding in these surveys is that male and female co-heads often
 give substantially different answers to the same questions.
 While some discordance is inevitable due to measurement error, recent studies
 have been searching for patterns in this disagreement, and suggest that
 systematic disagreement between spouses may be key in understanding intrahouseh
old power dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies on spousal disagreement often use a simple binary variable indicating
 that the answer of one co-head differs (to some degree) from the answer
 of the other co-head.
 In some cases, the direction of disagreement is also considered, differentiatin
g, for instance, between cases where male co-heads report higher levels
 of consumption than female co-heads, and cases where male co-heads report
 lower levels of consumption than female co-heads.
 Often, these questions relate to household-level data, such as consumption
 expenditure or investment in household public goods.
 However, studies interested in women's autonomy and women's empowerment
 go further by asking more personal questions on behaviors and personal
 belongings, and co-heads are typically asked to answer these questions
 about both themselves and their spouses.
 This own and cross-reporting allows for a range of interesting indicators
 of disagreement to be constructed, based primarily on what one co-head
 reports , and what his or her spouse reports about him or her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we focused mostly on directional disagreement indicators
 that exploit questions about behavior of individual spouses obtained from
 both co-heads.
 In addition to documenting patterns in spousal disagreement, we tested
 two interventions aimed at reducing disagreement related to decision-making,
 labor contributions, and marketing in maize farming.
 Both interventions pivoted on the screening of short engaging videos to
 co-heads within the household that both (1) provided viewers with a mental
 image of a cooperative household approach to maize farming through role
 modeling, and (2) reduced information asymmetries between spouses with
 specific technical insights on recommended maize cultivation practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found substantial disagreement between spouses.
 For instance, we found that co-heads exaggerate their own decision-making
 power on almost one in four plots.
 We found statistically significant reductions in the likelihood that co-heads
 overstate their own role in decision making as a result of the intervention
 that promotes a household cooperative approach to farming for decisions
 related to timing of planting and weeding.
 Similarly, we found that reducing information asymmetries between spouses
 led to a reduction in the likelihood that one co-head assigns him- or herself
 more decision-making power than the other spouse claimed.
 The likelihood of understating one's role in decision making was not significan
tly affected by either treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For labor, we found that co-heads seem to relatively overstate their own
 labor and underestimate their spouse's labor.
 However, we also found a substantial part of the sample where a co-head
 reported to work less than what the other spouse thinks (understating of
 own contributions which may point to labor-shirking behavior).
 We found that the likelihood that co-heads overstate own labor contributions
 in a number of farming activities reduced as a result of providing spouses
 with symmetric information that allowed them to better monitor each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For marketing, co-heads tend to overstate own sales, suggesting some degree
 of income hiding.
 At the same time, we did not find an effect of facilitating mutual monitoring.
 Promoting cooperation in farming within the household reduced the likelihood
 and degree of one co-head understating own sales, that is, reporting lower
 sales than what the other spouse assumed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that we found similar effects from both the intervention that projects
 a cooperative household farming approach and the intervention reducing
 information asymmetry suggests that two distinct mechanisms are likely
 at play.
 On one hand, some of the disagreement may be because one co-head overestimates
 his or her own role or position to make it appear in line with prevailing
 expectations, customs, and gender roles.
 Reducing this disagreement will involve longer-run efforts to challenge
 perceptions and gender stereotypes.
 Recent research has found that role models may be particularly effective
 for this 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "beaman2009powerful,porter2019gender"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, some disagreement may reflect deliberate appropriation
 of decisions, shirking, or income hiding.
 Here, interventions aimed at reducing the information disadvantage of one
 spouse, may also be effective.
