Cheating and Shirking: Spousal Disagreement among Ugandan Maize farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The household is often considered the primary unit of production in smallholder
 agriculture.
 However, to some extent, household members also compete over scarce resources
 and revenue.
 To gain a better understanding of intra-household bargaining processes,
 data on decision making, access to production assets and appropriation
 of revenue are now often collected from co-heads individually.
 Recent research has shown that answers provided by spouses on the same
 set of questions may differ substantially, and while this is partly due
 to measurement error, there is also evidence that at least part of this
 disagreement is due to differences in the information set held by the co-heads.
 Using detailed data on a large sample of monogamous smallholder maize farming
 households in eastern Uganda, we document patterns in spousal disagreement
 in decision making, reported labour time and sales.
 In two subsamples, we implement light weight interventions to test if we
 can increase reduce disagreement by increasing cooperation between spouses
 and reducing information asymmetries.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In subsistence agriculture, the prevailing unit of analysis is the agricultural
 household.
 However, these households consist of different household members, each
 with their own utility functions and access to resources.
 The preferences of the different household members may not perfectly align,
 and there may be considerable inequality in access to resources.
 This, in turn, may also result in differences in command over revenue obtained
 from selling agricultural commodities produced.
 The realization that household members compete as well as cooperate has
 led to a burgeoning literature grounded in collective bargain theory, with
 the important policy implication being that interventions may have different
 impact depending on who is targeted within the household

.
 Many interventions started to target women within households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Increased attention for the inner workings of the household farm by both
 researchers and practitioners also led to innovations in data collection

 One example is the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), a comprehen
sive and standardized measure to directly measure womenâ€™s empowerment and
 inclusion in the agricultural sector

\end_inset

.
 More generally, the focus on intra-household processes has substantially
 increased the availability of data that is collected at the individual
 household member level, especially of the co-heads of the households.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies that collect data from male and female co-heads separately find
 that spouses often provide different answers on the most basic questions,
 such as for instance the number of household members or when asked about
 household assets.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 demonstrate that while part of the this may be attributable to measurement
 error, there is also a systematic component that reflects asymmetric informatio
n within households.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a first objective of this paper, we use detailed data from both male
 and female co-heads of monogamous semi-subsistence farm households in eastern
 Uganda to contributes to a growing literature that provides insight into
 intra-household processes by collecting data from multiple household members.
 A key paper on spousal disagreement is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 It provides a theoretical framework to explain spousal disagreement in
 survey data collected at the level of the individual co-heads.
 The model differentiates between three types of bias: (1) random measurement
 error that affects both spouses symmetrically; (2) systematic error, where
 for example the male co-head always exaggerates; and (3) information asymmetrie
s.
 Using this framework, they find evidence of significant information asymmetries
 between spouses in Bangladeshi households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arguably the most interesting form of spousal disagreement is the one that
 stems from information asymmetries.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argue that the fact that bias is larger for some assets (eg for assets
 that can be hidden more easily) than for others suggests that asymmetric
 information in the form of hidden assets and decisions is present in the
 household
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
However, while most studies on spousal disagreement seem to assume that
 information asymmetry is a sign that individuals hide resources or actions
 from other household members, information asymmetry does not always have
 to be the result of one spouse intentionally deceiving another.
 There may be other systematic biases that manifest more in one asset or
 decision category than others.
 We think of cognitive bias that may be shaped by prevailing gender norms.
 For example, when society sees spraying chemicals as a dangerous activity
 that only men should do, men may exaggerate the resources they allocated
 to this task and the decision power in this sphere.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 A number of lab-in-the-field experiments indeed confirm that household
 members conceal resources from one another

\end_inset

.
 We contribute to this line of research by looking at disagreement with
 respect to a range of maize farming related decisions, difference in options
 on individual time allocations to particular tasks, and income hiding..
 In particular, at the plot level, we look at how decisions are made on
 a series of important agronomic practices.
 We also look at who provides labour for different agronomic activities
 such as land preparation, planting, weeding and harvesting.
 We further look at maize sales and patterns of income hiding between spouses.
 We finally collected some information on how spouses deal with agricultural
 related disagreement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above, new ways of thinking about intra-household decision
 making had a significant impact policies and interventions.
 However, impact evaluations of interventions that explicitly target women
 within households did not always produce the expected results.
 Partly, this was explained by the fact that the pendulum may have swung
 too far the other way and the importance of cooperation within the household
 had been ignored 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12540"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Many resources are jointly owned and decisions jointly made, and so the
 clear division between man managed and women managed plots underlying bargainin
g models may be the exception rather that the rule

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, alternative models of the household have been proposed that
 provide more room for intra-household cooperation.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doss2015collective"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 point out that households face collective action problems similar to those
 studied in the context of common pool resources management.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second contribution of this paper is thus to test a light touch intervention
 aimed at increasing cooperation between spouses and reducing information
 asymmetries in the form of hidden assets or decision making.
 Inspired by recent research on behavioral change communication and social
 marketing, we design an video intervention that promotes a mental model
 of farming as a joint venture, with both spouses having an equal role in
 decision making, activities, and rewards.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The next section presents
 the research questions, the interventions we use to test the research hypothese
s, and the underlying theory of change.
 We then present the experimental design and test pre-treatment balance
 between the different treatment groups on a range of household characteristics.
 We then turn to the results, first looking at how the interventions affect
 joint decision making.
 We then test if increasing cooperation also leads to a more equitable distribut
ion of labor.
 As changes in aspirations have been found to affect forward looking behavior
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, we also look at the impact of the interventions on intentions to invest
 proceeds from maize farming.
 We then explore household level outcomes.
 A next section explores spousal disagreement and we also report effects
 on the likelihood that farmers tell each other in the event of disagreement.
 A final section concludes.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is from an earlier version of the cooperation paper: Many studies have
 found substantial disagreement about what men and women separately report
 in agriculture 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "doi:10.1086/703082"

\end_inset

.
 If spouses monitor each other better, we can expect that there is less
 disagreement about practices and inputs used on maize plots.
 As mentioned above, the ability of spouses to monitor each other may be
 one of the mechanisms through which our interventions affect outcomes.
 We thus look at a range of practices and inputs, and verify if spouses
 are more or less likely to agree on the fact that these practices or inputs
 were adopted on a particular plot depending on the treatment group.
 The results from comparisons between treatment and control for both treatments
 are summarized by an index of disagreement on recommended agronomic practices
 and modern inputs in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Disagreement"

\end_inset

.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:disagree_adopt"

\end_inset

 provides detailed information.
 From this table, we see that there is substantial variation in disagreement
 between the different activities and practices.
 For instance, on almost 60 percent of maize plots, spouses disagree about
 the timing of planting that was used on the plot.
 There is far less disagreement about plant spacing and seed density, partly
 because there are only a few common ways of planting maize: here spouses
 disagreed about planting method on only 8 percent of plots.
 Overall, we do not find that reducing information asymmetry reduces that
 likelihood that spouses report that different practices or technologies
 were used on a given plot.
 In fact, we find that in the sub-group of farmers where the video was shown
 to both spouses, the likelihood that one spouse says fertilizer was used
 and the other spouse says this was not the case, increases.
 This suggests that reducing information asymmetry did not lead spouses
 to better monitor each other.
 There are also no effects of projecting a household cooperative approach.

Even though the interventions did not seem to increase monitoring of agronomic
 practices, it may be that spouses are more focused on output, and as a
 result, may engage in closer monitoring of production.
 As mentioned in the previous section, we asked husband and wife separately
 to estimate how much maize was harvested on each maize plot.
 Similarly, we asked each spouse about the area on which this maize was
 planted.
 Both measures are then combined to calculate yields as estimated by the
 husband and the wife separately.
 We then define disagreement as the absolute difference between what was
 reported by the husband and by the wife.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:disagree_prod"

\end_inset

 shows that these differences are large.
 For instance, the difference in the estimates of area between spouses is
 more than half an acre (with the average household cultivating maize on
 1.2 acres).
 Average household level production in our sample is about 512 kg of maize,
 and the difference in the estimates of production between spouses is 287
 kg.
 This combines into an even larger difference for yields: almost 360 (while
 average yields are 530 kg per acre).
 We find no effect from reducing information asymmetry.
 For the second intervention, all outcomes do seem to go in the same direction,
 suggesting that projecting a household cooperative approach to farming
 reduces disagreement in production related outcomes, but not significantly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Next, we look at disagreement with respect to labor time invested in agriculture.
 For instance, it may be that increasing cooperation may reduce the tendency
 to shirk by the spouses.
 Here, we exploit the fact that we did not only ask spouses about their
 own labor time on each of the activities in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Analysis-of-time"

\end_inset

; we also asked each spouse to provide an estimate of the time that the
 other spouse spent on each activity.
 We define disagreement about the husband's labor supply as the difference
 between what was reported by the husband himself and what the wife reported
 as her husband's contribution.
 Similarly, we define disagreement about the wife's labor supply as the
 time she reported working and what the husband thinks she worked.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Disagreement"

\end_inset

 suggests that reducing information asymmetry reduces disagreement about
 labor somewhat.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:disagree_labor"

\end_inset

 shows that this effect is mainly due a reduction in disagreement about
 women's labor, as the gap between what the women reported and what the
 man reports that he thinks this wife works reduces significantly.
 Most of this effect is due to the fact that women reduce labor and bring
 it more in line with man's estimate, consistent with the results reported
 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:time_use_full"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Finally, we also look at disagreement with respect to amounts of maize sold.
 Income hiding by one of the spouses has been documented in several contexts
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "castilla2013ignorance"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 We conjecture that encouraging cooperation may lead to a reduction in income
 hiding.
 We assess the impact on income hiding through four outcomes.
 The first outcome simply looks at disagreement about whether sales have
 happened or not.
 If one of the spouses says that (part of the) maize was sold but the other
 says this was not the case, this may be a sign of income hiding.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:disagree_sales"

\end_inset

 shows that in almost one third of the households, there is disagreement
 this.
 We also asked each of the spouses separately to estimate how much was sold
 by (1) him or her, (2) by his or her spouse, and (3) jointly.
 Using this, we calculate the difference between what the husband reported
 to have sold alone and what the wife estimated was sold by her husband
 alone.
 Similarly, we calculate the difference between what the wife reported to
 have sold alone and what the husband estimated was sold by his wife alone.
 For joint sales, we take the absolute value of the difference between what
 was reported by the husband and the wife.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:disagree_sales"

\end_inset

 shows there is some degree of income hiding, but there does not seem to
 be an impact from our interventions.

\begin_layout Standard
As a second hypothesis, we will therefore test whether projecting a household
 cooperative approach to farming leads to better outcomes.
 Also here, we posit different impact pathways.
 First, there may be aspirational effects of seeing a couple farming maize
 successfully together.
 The intervention may also serve to challenge social norms and gender roles
 that prescribe that men specialize in productive and women in reproductive
 activities.
 This may lead women to become more assertive when men take decisions or
 it may make men more open to women participation in farming.
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Also here, can we look more into mechanisms? Unfortunately, we threw out
 all questions that attempted to measure aspirations, but maybe we can argue
 that the decision to invest in agriculture is indicative of an aspirational
 effect?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farming happens in a particular cultural context, and social norms may hamper
 efficient allocation of production factors.
 For instance, in patrilineal societies it may be that only men are assumed
 to make decisions on certain crops, or only women are allowed to carry
 out certain activities.
 However, norms and customs can change, and role models have been found
 to be important catalysts

 We therefore devise an intervention aimed at promoting a cooperative approach

The study involved a among a random sample of maize farmers in southwestern
 Uganda.
 Two-stage cluster sampling was used to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, from five districts (Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo,
 and Namutumba), we first selected 50 parishes randomly and in proportion
 to the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all the households, from which we sampled
 10 households to be included in the study.
 This resulted in a total sample size of 3,280 households.
 However, to investigate cooperation within the household, we only use household
s where we managed to interview both spouses separately, which was the case
 in 2,548 households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intervention was only implemented on a subset of the data.
 In 261 households, a video was shown where a couple is depicted, while
 in 475 households, a video was shown where the recommended practices were
 illustrated by a man or a woman alone.

 data was collected in August 2017).
 For instance, we found that at the time of baseline data collection, average
 yields in the sample amounted to about 264 kg per acre

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is a very low yield; during focus group discussions, we learned that
 yields are normally about 500 to 700 kg per acre.

.
 Average age of the household head in our sample is 40 years and only about
 36 percent reported to have finished primary education.
 The average household has more than 7 members who live in a house with
 2.2 bedrooms.
 Only 11 percent had access to agricultural extension in the preceding year,
 about 20 percent used (inorganic) fertilizer and almost 40 percent reported
 to have used improved seed.
 Average distance to the nearest agro-input dealer is 5.5 km and almost 80
 percent of households own a mobile phone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second column, we report differences in means at baseline between
 households that received the extension information as a couple and households
 where only one of the spouses (either the husband of the wife) received
 the information.
 We find significant imbalance on various baseline characteristics for this
 first treatment.
 For instance, we see that in the sub-sample of households that were given
 the information as a couple, the household head is almost 4 years older
 than in households where the information was given to only one of the spouses.
 Household heads in households that were treated as a couple are also significan
tly more likely to have finished primary education.
 We further find that these households are about 10 percentage points more
 likely to own a mobile phone and 5 percentage points less likely to have
 used fertilizer.
 We also have some indications that access to extension and households size
 is correlated with the treatment.
 A test for joint orthogonality also indicates that there are significant
 differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups.
 The third column of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 compares households where a video was shown featuring a couple role model
 to households that got to see a video in which a male maize farmer did
 all the acting.
 For this treatment, we find balance among almost all baseline characteristics.
 We also can not reject joint orthogonality.

Both experiments are implemented using short videos that were shown to farmers
 on tablet computers.
 The videos were designed with a dual purpose in mind.
 First, the videos serve to transfer knowledge about recommended agronomic
 management practices and the use of modern technologies.
 It is shown how fields need to be prepared using organic fertilizer.
 Proper seed spacing and seeding rates and it importance are explained.
 furthermore, it is shown in detail how inorganic fertilizer needs to be
 applied and in what quantities.
 Furthermore, attention is devoted to identifying striga, a parasitic weed
 that affects maize yields in the area.
 We also devote ample attention to the importance of seed quality and recommend
 using hybrid seed or Open Pollinated Varieties (OPV).
 Other recommended practices include timely planting and weeding.
 Second, the information was packaged as an inspirational story of poor
 farmers that, over time, are able to break out of a poverty trap.
 The video starts with a farmer explaining that he used to struggle with
 low yields, producing barely enough food to feed his family, but that over
 the years, he learned how to increase the number of bags of maize produced
 on his maize plots.
 It is shown how the farmer starts using recommended practices on a small
 part of his land.
 It is also shown how he sells a chicken and borrows some money from a neighbor
 to buy improved seed and fertilizer.
 The return on this initial investment is then re-invested, and the viewer
 is taken through some basic inter-temporal cost-benefit calculations.
 The video ends by showing a happy farmer that assures the viewer that he
 or she can also become a successful farmer by following his example.

\begin_layout Standard
To answer the first research questionâ€“whether reducing information asymmetry
 within households is effectiveâ€“we compare outcomes of households in which
 the couple (husband and wife together) is shown a video to outcomes of
 households in which with only one co-head of the household (husband or
 wife) is shown the video.
 To answer the second research questionâ€“whether promoting a household cooperativ
e approach to farming is effectiveâ€“we compare outcomes of households where
 an aspirational video was shown in which a man and woman participate as
 equals on the family farm and deliver the message as a couple to outcomes
 of households where where an aspirational video was shown featuring only
 a man.

\begin_layout Standard
In this section,we start by exploring patterns of decision making related
 to maize growing within the household.
 We asked the head of the household to list all maize plots that the household
 was cultivating during the season preceding the survey, which was the second
 agricultural seasons of 2018.
 We then cycle through the different plots and repeat a series of questions
 for each plot.
 The same questions were asked separately to each co-head.
 We asked, for a range of key decisions that need to be made and that are
 known to significantly affect maize yields, who made the decision on that
 particular plot.
 Respondents could answer that decisions were made by the person that was
 interviewed alone; by the spouse of the person interviewed alone; by the
 person interviewed and his or her spouse jointly; by someone else inside
 or outside the household; by the person interviewed together with someone
 else inside or outside the household; or by the spouse jointly with someone
 else inside or outside the household.
 Respondents could also indicate that they did not know who made the decision.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by looking at the responses given by the male co-heads within the
 household (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision-making"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The first decision we consider was simply who decided maize should be planted
 on the particular plot.
 A second decision is related to timing of planting.
 Timely planting of maize is very important for subsequent maize yields.
 Maize planting should start immediately after the first rains of the season,
 resulting in significant time pressure when large areas need to be planted.
 A third important decision that maize farmers have to make is related to
 the spacing of seed and seed rate.
 There is a wide range of seed methods used by farmers.
 Some simply broadcast the seeds.
 However, row planting leads to significantly higher yields as plants have
 optimal space to obtain sufficient sun and nutrients.
 Farmers also often plant more than one seed per hill, because they fear
 some seeds may not geminate.
 However, planting more than one seed per hill may also increase competition
 for light and nutrients, leading to stunted growth.
 It is therefore recommended to use only one seed per hill and engage in
 gap filling when seeds do not germinate after one week.
 We also asked who made decisions related to weed control.
 For weeding, we differentiate between decision making related to strategies
 used to combat striga infestations and weeding more general.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows that, at least according to the male co-head, joint decision making
 is the norm.
 For example, on the 3,723 maize plots on which data was collected, men
 indicate that on 1,947 plots the decision to start planting maize was taken
 together with the wife.
 This corresponds to about 52 percent of plots.
 The pattern seems to be rather consistent across the different decision
 spheres.
 For the decision on how to fight striga, the percentage drops to 42 percent,
 but this is due to the fact that part of the plots, striga was not a problem
 and so no decision needed to be made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure also shows that on one out of three plots, the male co-head states
 that decisions are made by him alone, without consulting his wife.
 Also here, the percentages remain stable across the decision makings spheres,
 with a slightly higher incidence of male co-head unilateral decision making
 on spacing and slightly less unilateral male decision making on weeding.
 Finally, the figure also shows that, according to men, women decide to
 plant maize without consulting their husband on 414 out of the total 3,723
 plots, corresponding to about 11 percent.
 This share is also stable over the five decision spheres considered in
 the figure, with slightly more decisions taken by women on weeding and
 slight less on seed spacing.

, but now shows responses as provided by the female co-head.
 Also here, we see that women report that decisions are generally made jointly:
 on the 3,723 maize plots in the sample, the woman co-head indicates that
 on 1,892 plots the decision to start planting maize was taken by the male
 and female co-head together.
 Also for the other decisions, on about half of all plots women say the
 decision was made jointly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Women also report that it is more common that men take decisions alone than
 that women take decisions alone.
 For instance, women report that on 1,015 out of the 3,723 maize plots,
 man took the decision to start planting without consulting anyone else.
 However, there is less consistency over the different decision spheres.
 Men are relatively less likely to unilaterally decide on weeding related
 activities.
 Finally, women report that they make decisions unilaterally on about 15
 percent of the plots.

 suggest some degree of disagreement between spouses.
 For instance, while male co-heads indicated that they alone took the decision
 to plant maize on about 32 percent of the plots, women say that man unilaterall
y took the decision to plant maize on only 27 percent of the plots.
 At the same time, female co-heads say they alone decided to plant maize
 on 16 percent of the plots.
 Men indicate that women unilaterally decided to plant maize on only 11
 percent of the plots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate this disagreement further, we construct two indices based
 on answers of both spouses.
 A first indicator, labeled female disagreement, is true if the male co-head
 claims he was involved in the decision (that is, he responds that he took
 the decision alone or the decision was taken jointly), while his wife says
 the particular decision was taken by her alone.
 A second indictor, labeled male disagreement, is true if the women co-head
 says she was involved in the particular decision (either because she took
 the decision alone or jointly with her husband), while the husband claims
 the decision was taken by him without consultation of his wife.
 This is similar to one of the measures of disagreement in decision making
 used in

 At the same time, we see that on about 17 percent of all plots, the female
 co-head thinks she was involved in the decision to plant maize, but the
 male co-head indicates he made the decision alone.

.
 The second column shows the average treatment effect of the treatment and
 reveals that there is no effect of the treatment on this outcome.
 This comparison between those who saw the couple video and those who saw
 a video with a single actor is repeated for all five decision spheres.
 We do find a significant impact of the intervention on the the likelihood
 that women disagree that the man was involved in decisions related to weeding.
 Here we see that among households where the video was shown with a single
 actor providing all the information, women say they took the decision related
 to weeding alone while men think they were involved on 12.5 percent of plots.
 Among households that were exposed to the video the features a couple,
 this type of disagreement occurs on only 8.4 percent of plots.

\begin_layout Standard
In the third column, we report control group means for the share of plots
 on which women claim they were involved in decision making but men say
 they took the decision unilaterally.
 Again in line with Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision"
plural "false"

\end_inset

, we see for instance that this type of disagreement on when to plant maize
 applies to about 18 percent of the plots.
 The fourth column shows that disagreement on the timing reduced by 6.3 percentag
e points among households that received the couple role model treatment.
 We also see a significant reduction in men disagreeing that women were
 involved in decisions related to spacing of maize seed.
 More generally, for the couple role model treatment, while not all coefficients
 are statistically significant, they are all negative, indicating that the
 treatment reduced disagreement with respect to decision making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next turn to the second treatment and compare disagreement on decision
 making between co-heads in households where only one co-head viewed the
 video and households where the video was shown to both co-heads.
 Column 5 of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:decisions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 show that in households where only one of the co-heads was exposed to the
 video, the female co-head said she decided to plant maize alone while the
 male co-head thought he was involved in this decision on about 13 percent
 of the plots.
 Column 6 indicates that this percentage was 3.1 percentage points lower
 among households where both spouses was shown the video, although the reduction
 in disagreement is not statistically different from zero.
 We do, however, find significant reductions in this type of disagreement
 for decisions related to spacing and weeding among households where both
 spouses were treated with the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the last two columns, we look at the impact of providing both spouses
 with the same information on the likelihood that the male co-head says
 he took the decision alone while the female co-head thinks she was involved.
 Control group means are again in close to what we find in the entire sample
 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 We find again that disagreement reduced somewhat as a result of targeting
 both spouses with information, but only for decisions relate to the timing
 of planting and the difference is only significant at the 10 percent significan
t level.
 However, also for this treatment, all but one of the coefficients are estimated
 negative, suggesting that overall, targeting the couple with information
 instead on only one co-head reduced disagreement with respect to decision
 making in agriculture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Division of labour
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also collected detailed information on labour.
 On each maize plot, we ask each co-head how much time, expressed in labour
 days, he or she worked on a particular activity.
 We also ask each co-head to give an estimate of how much time his or her
 spouse worked on the plot on that particular task.
 The activities we inquired about are land preparation, planting, weeding,
 spraying and harvesting.
 Weeding happens at three different times, but is aggregated into one measure
 for this analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-spent-man"

\end_inset

 shows time spent on different activities as reported by the male co-head.
 We see that the male co-head spends about 8 days preparing the plot, 2
 days planting, almost 15 days weeding, one day of spraying and another
 2 days harvesting.
 The figure also shows that the male co-head reports that his wife spends
 one day less in preparing the land and also half a day less in weeding.
 Men think women almost never engage in spraying of insecticides, herbicides
 or fungicides.
 The average male co-head in our sample thus reports to work about 28 days
 on the average plot over the entire agricultural season.
 He reports that women work about 26 days on that plot over the entire season.

, but now as reported by the female co-head within the household.
 Interestingly, while male co-heads think they spent more time on all activities
, female co-heads are also of the opinion that they work harder than men
 on all activities, the only exception being spraying.
 Female co-heads claim they work on average about 7 to 8 days on field preparati
on on a plot, while they think the male co-head only work 6 days.
 Female co-heads also indicate that they spend 16.5 days on weeding, while
 men spend only 13.5 days on that activity.
 Male and female co-heads spend about the same time on planting and harvesting.
 Only for spraying, they agree that the male co-head provides most of the
 work.
 According to the female co-head, she works almost 30 days, while the male
 co-head works about 25 days over the entire season.

 again suggests substantial disagreement between spouses on time worked.
 For instance, we see that male co-heads report that they work on average
 about 8 days to prepare the land, yet women indicate that men only work
 6 days to prepare the land.
 Women on the other hand report that they work on average 16 days on the
 field to weed, while men think that women only work 14 days on the field
 for weeding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While on average, spouses tend to overestimate their own labour and underestimat
e their spouses labour, there is also a substantial part of the sample where
 a co-head reports to work less than what the other thinks.
 We will refer to this type of disagreement in labour reported as shirking.
 For the analysis, we define shirking as a simple binary event where a male
 co-head shirks on a particular activity if he reports he worked fewer hours
 than his wife thinks.
 A female co-head shirks if she works less than the male co-head thinks.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Shirking"

 shows shirking by spouses.
 For example, we find that on about 30 percent of the plots, the male co-head
 spends less time preparing the land than the female co-head thinks he does.
 For the task of preparing the land, women shirk slightly more.
 However, in general, the figure indicates male co-heads shirk more than
 female co-heads.
 Shirking is highest for men when it comes to weeding: On 40 percent of
 the plots, male co-heads put in less time than their female co-head thinks
 he does.

Maize sales
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at maize sales.
 Also here, we asked each spouse separately how much maize was sold from
 the season under consideration.
 In particular, we asked each of the spouses separately to estimate how
 much was sold by (1) him or her, (2) by his or her spouse, and (3) jointly

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We specify that sales by an individuals means all decisions regarding quantity,
 price and to whom to sell were taken by that individual without involving
 anyone else.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We also asked them to indicate the revenue that was derived from these
 sales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Men report that households sold on average 1.4 bags of maize as a couple
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A typical bag contains about 120 kilograms of maize.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Women report that they sold just under one bag as a household.
 Averaged over the entire sample, joint sales amounted to about 23 dollars,
 at least as reported by the male co-head.
 Women estimated this amount much lower at 13 dollars.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As this paper is more about spousals disagreement, we focus on unilateral
 sales as reported by both spouses.
 Figure

\end_inset

 shows in the left panel that men reported they sold half a bag themselves.
 Women reported that the male co-head only sold 0.25 bags of maize.
 This may indicate that the average male co-head in our sample sold about
 one quarter of a bag behind the female co-head's back.
 Women, on the other hand, report that they sold only about 12 kilograms
 of maize alone.
 Men think that the female co-head unilaterally sold about 6 kilograms.
 As such, in percentage terms, quantities hidden is similar between male
 and female co-heads.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The right panel of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Maize-sales"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 looks at income derived from these sales.
 Male co-heads indicate that they received about 7.6 dollars on average from
 their unilateral sales of maize.
 Women estimate this revenue to be only about 2 dollar.
 The fact that the gap between what men report and what women report has
 increased dramatically may indicate that men also hide income by reporting
 to the female co-head lower prices than what they actually received for
 the maize.
 This seems to be less the case for women, where differences in male and
 female reported revenues are in line with differences in quantities sold.

\begin_layout Standard
As in previous sections, we look at the impact of the two interventions
 on disagreement related to maize sales.
 We conjecture that encouraging cooperation and reducing information asymmetries
 between spouses may lead to a reduction in income hiding.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:income_hiding"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 reports results for three outcomes.
 A first outcome is a simple binary indicator that takes the value of one
 if a spouse appears to engage in concealing sales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first row in the table shows that among households that were shown a
 video with only one actor, about 14 percent of male co-heads sold more
 than what the female co-head thought.
 In this same subset, about 6 percent of female co-heads sold more than
 what the male co-head thought the female co-head sold.
 We do not find that these rates are significantly different among households
 that were given the couple role model treatment video.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, the right panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:income_hiding"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 reports result for the second treatment.
 It shows that there is also no impact of providing both spouses with the
 same information on the likelihood that spouses engage in income hiding.
 We further consider quantities hidden in rows 3 and 4 of the table, and
 translate this into income obtained from selling these quantities in rows
 5 and 6.
 Overall, we do not find that our interventions affect disagreement related
 to maize sales.

Conflict resolution

\begin_layout Standard
Spouses may disagree about certain maize production activities.
 We ask each spouse separately whether, in case of disagreement about any
 maize related issue, they would tell their spouse that they disagree.
 Respondents were allowed to indicate the likelihood that they would tell
 the other spouse on a scale of 1 (never) to 5 (always).

.
 We see that, generally, spouses communicate well.
 About two in three men indicate that they would tell their wife if they
 do not agree with something.
 This is not too different for female co-heads.
 Based on these two variables, we also construct a new dummy variable that
 is one if both spouses indicate that they would always or mostly tell each
 other if they do not agree.
 In the entire sample, we find that out of 2,544 households, about 1,435
 households report always or mostly tell each other if they disagree.

As a follow up questions, we also asked what happens when one spouse tells
 the other that he or she does not agree.
 Here, we focus on instances where spouses indicate that they discuss and
 come to a solution that is mutually agreed upon.
 We find that in the entire sample, 66 percent of male co-heads agree in
 that spouses talk and come to a solution.
 Again, we find little difference between men and women: 65 percent of women
 indicate that a mutually beneficial solution is sought.
 In half of all households in our sample, there is agreement between spouses
 that a mutually agreed upon solution is discussed.

 looks at the impact of our role model intervention on communication and
 conflict resolution within the household.
 We do not find that the intervention increases the likelihood that male
 co-heads tell the female co-heads if they disagree (column 2, row 1).
 We also do not find a significant impact on the likelihood that the female
 co-head tells the male co-head if she disagrees (column 4, row 1).
 We also do not find that the intervention increases two way communication
 (column 6, row 1).
 We do, however, find that the intervention increases the likelihood that
 man indicate that a mutual agreement is sought when there is disagreement
 (column 2, row 3).
 The effect is even larger on the likelihood that there is agreement between
 spouses that a solution that is acceptable to both is sought.
