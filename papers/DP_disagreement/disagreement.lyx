\begin_layout Title
Hiding, Shirking, or Pleasing: Spousal Disagreement among Ugandan Maize
 Farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To gain a better understanding of intrahousehold bargaining processes, surveys
 increasingly collect data from co-heads individually, especially on decision-ma
king, asset ownership and labor contributions.
 However, answers provided by co-heads to the same set of questions often
 differ substantially.
 Recent research suggests that while some of this disagreement is due to
 random measurement error and cognitive bias, part also reflects non-overlapping
 information sets.
 We document differences in answers between male and female co-heads in
 monogamous smallholder maize-farming households in Uganda.
 We first confirm that not all disagreement can be explained by measurement
 error or bias.
 Using a field experiment, we then test if disagreement is due to information
 asymmetry between male and female co-heads.
 We also test an alternative explanation where discord is attributed to
 co-heads' tendency to respond in line with prevailing gender norms and
 social customs.
 While the interventions did seem to reduce discord in survey response about
 decision-making, we do not find that information asymmetry nor reporting
 in line with gender norms and customs are the primary drivers of disagreement.

Increased attention to the internal dynamics of agricultural households
 by both researchers and practitioners has led to various innovations in
 data collection

 Examples of best practice in data collection on intrahousehold dynamics
 include separate interviewing of male and female co-heads of (dual-headed)
 households using distinct survey instruments that may nonetheless cover
 common topics and questions.
 Studies using these instruments often find that co-heads provide different
 answers to even the most basic questions

 demonstrate that, while part of these divergent responses may be attributable
 to measurement error, there is also a systematic component that reflects
 asymmetric information within households where one co-head does not have
 accurate knowledge about the decisions made, actions taken, or assets owned
 by the other.
 Furthermore, they show that disagreement is larger for assets and decisions
 that are easier to hide, possibly indicating that spouses hide information
 from each other.
 A number of lab-in-the-field experiments similarly indicate that household
 members often conceal some of their resources from each other

In this paper, we investigate spousal disagreement in survey responses from
 monogamous smallholder maize-farming households in eastern Uganda.
 Drawing on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, we explore the same three types of explanation for discord—random measurement
 error, bias caused by men and women interpreting questions differently,
 and asymmetric information where men and women have only partly overlapping
 information sets.
 However, while 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"

\end_inset

 use variation in the probability of overall disagreement by asset and activity
 to draw conclusions about asymmetric information, we designed a field experimen
t to formally test the asymmetric information hypothesis.
 This is done by randomly assigning a sample of households to a video-based
 intervention designed to reduce information advantages of a single spouse,
 and then comparing spousal disagreement to a control group.
 Furthermore, we test for an alternative explanation: that discord is not
 the result of asymmetric information, but is instead caused by spouses
 answering survey questions in line with prevailing gender norms.
 Inspired by recent research on the use of role models to change attitudes
 and behavior in traditionally male dominated sectors, we also test the
 impact of a video-based intervention that aims to promote a mental image
 of maize farming as a cooperative or joint venture in which both spouses
 play an equal role

\begin_layout Standard
We consider spousal disagreement with respect to the role of both female
 and male co-heads in decision-making and labor provision.
 For disagreement about the female co-head's role in decision-making, we
 consider the likelihood that the female co-head reports she was involved
 in decision making but the male co-head says she was not.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the literature, this type of disagreement is interpreted in different
 ways.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 note this is consistent with women (intentionally or unintentionally) hiding
 decisions from their husband, while 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 consider this proof of women taking power.
 We follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"

\end_inset

 in interpreting this as instances where the female co-head could be hiding
 her decisions or the husband simply is not cognizant of the full range
 of decisions that she makes.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For disagreement about the male co-head's role in decision-making, we consider
 the likelihood that the male co-head reports he was involved in the decision
 but the female co-head says he was not.
 For labor provision, we focus on instances where the one co-head reports
 to have worked less than how much the other co-head reports they worked,
 which could be indicative of shirking.
 We examine disagreement on time spent by both female and male co-heads.

We realize that the term “shirking” may carry a pejorative connotation.
 That is not the intention here.
 Rather, shirking is defined in the context of this paper as putting in
 less effort than what is expected, consistent with its usage in labor economics
 and models of efficiency wages and moral hazard problems that stem from
 situations in which parties to a contract have some discretion over their
 labor effort due to monitoring problems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.2307/1804018"

.
 Our study aligns with this literature in that our strategy to test for
 the presence of “shirking” exploits heterogeneity in the ability to monitor
 different activities.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that measurement error alone can not explain observed spousal disagreeme
nt in survey responses.
 We also reject the idea that differences in how male and female co-heads
 interpret the questions is the main driver behind observed disagreement.
 For decision making, we find that both interventions significantly reduce
 disagreement about the role of the female co-head.
 Disagreement about the role of the male co-head is only reduced by the
 video-based intervention that is intended to reduce information asymmetry.
 However, further inquiry into the impact pathways do not allow us to determine
 the exact mechanisms for the impact.
 Finally, we conclude that the video-based intervention does not affect
 disagreement related to labor time allocations.

\begin_layout Section
Literature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our review of prior work on spousal disagreement focuses mainly on the empirical
 literature on intrahousehold resource allocation and decision-making in
 (dual-headed) agricultural households in low- and middle-income countries,
 and draws primarily on analyses that use observational data from surveys
 in which both male and female co-heads are interviewed separately and are
 asked the same set of questions.
 Such studies often focus on research questions related to women's empowerment
 and autonomy.
 For example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1728-4465.2002.00299.x"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 asks both co-heads questions on the locus of decision-making on a variety
 of issues, as well as specific questions concerning women's mobility and
 access to resources.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 collect data from both co-heads on a range of autonomy-related topics,
 including the need of the female co-head to obtain the male co-head's permissio
n to go to different types of places, the female co-head's capacity to decide
 on their children's affairs, whether the female co-head is allowed to have
 a job, and her role in deciding on the number of children and on household
 expenditures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common finding in studies that ask the same set of questions to different
 individuals within the household is that substantial disagreement often
 arises between co-heads, even on questions that would seem easily and objective
ly verifiable, such as the number of children or type of material used for
 house construction.
 This divergence may simply be attributable to measurement error by the
 respondents.
 But 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggest that such divergence may also be partly due to the fact that the
 response categories do not have the same cognitive or semantic meanings
 to women and men.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "SEYMOUR201897"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 note that co-heads often give inconsistent answers when asked about who
 made a particular decision.
 They then test whether female unilateral decision-making is equally empowering
 if the male co-head disagrees that the woman took the decision alone, as
 compared to when the male co-head agrees.
 They conclude that disagreement may signal underlying power dynamics within
 the household that are likely to be relevant when assessing individual-level
 agency and empowerment.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANNAN2021105292"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 similarly examine underlying power dynamics, focusing on cases where the
 female co-head reported she made decisions, while the male co-head said
 the female co-head was not involved.
 They refer to this type of disagreement as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

women taking power
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and show that it is positively correlated with a range of outcomes for
 women and children.
 They conclude that more research is needed to establish causality and identify
 which interventions affect disagreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"

\end_inset

 provide a particularly insightful conceptual framework that teases out
 the various perspectives on spousal disagreement.
 First, they note that if disagreement solely derives from measurement error,
 disagreement should be symmetric, and the female co-head's responses should
 not differ systematically from the male co-head's responses.
 Second, they point out that if disagreement results from asymmetric measurement
 error in which men and women interpret questions differently (as suggested
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANDERSON2017169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), then answers should differ systematically between co-heads, but disagreement
 should be similar for different questions asked in a survey (or at least
 for a sets of similar questions like questions related to asset ownership
 or different decisions).
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is important to note the implicit assumption that asymmetric measurement
 error has its origin at the level of the individuals within the household
 (for example the female co-head has lower education leading her to systematical
ly underestimate effort), and so should not lead to heterogeneity within
 the household.
 Therefore, instead of referring to this as asymmetric measurement error,
 we see this more as bias caused by factors that emanate from the individual
 level.
 Generally, this individual level variation will manifest itself in differing
 cognitive capacities of co-heads and differences in how questions are interpret
ed by male and female co-heads 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this paper, we will refer to this type of disagreement as cognitive
 bias, rather than categorizing this as a type of measurement error.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Finally, they argue that finding differing rates of disagreement across
 survey questions, and higher rates of disagreement for assets and activities
 that are easier to hide in particular, points to the presence of intrahousehold
 information asymmetries.
 Using observational data collected in Bangladesh, they find evidence that
 such information asymmetries in the form of hidden assets and decisions
 are present in their sampled households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, differential disagreement on different decisions, asset categories,
 or activities need not always reflect intrahousehold information asymmetry.
 There may be other reasons why spouses agree more in one area and less
 in another area.
 One reason may be that spouses respond in line with what society expects
 from them, such that disagreement related to decisions, actions, and asset
 ownership is also partly shaped by prevailing gender stereotypes and norms,
 i.e., role congruity.
 For example, in a case study in northern Uganda, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that men often report unilateral decision-making in areas where they
 are assumed to bear final responsibility, even if women had some degree
 of involvement.
 Women rather report these scenarios as joint decisions.
 Hence, it is important to understand the local cultural context to differentiat
e spousal disagreement as a function of information asymmetries stemming
 from information asymmetry versus other gender-related systematic biases.

\begin_layout Section

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to random error and cognitive bias due to spouses interpreting
 questions differently, the previous section shows that the emerging literature
 on spousal disagreement in survey responses suggests two potential mechanisms.
 First, spousal disagreement may be due to the cultural context in which
 these questions are asked and answered, with co-heads responding in line
 with what would be expected in society 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Second, the literature also suggests that spousal disagreement reflects
 information asymmetries between co-heads, for example when co-heads hide
 decisions, actions and assets from each other 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We designed two corresponding interventions to empirically test these two
 explanations in a field experiment.
 A first intervention attempts to challenge preconceived ideas of what decision-
making by a male or female co-head involves and who is expected to make
 decisions in a farm-household by promoting a cooperative approach to maize
 farming, in which maize cultivation and management activities are seen
 as a joint responsibility of both co-heads.
 A second intervention tests if these asymmetries can be influenced by providing
 co-heads equal access to information about best practices in maize farming
 prior to the point in time when decisions are made on cultivation and managemen
t, as this would facilitate mutual monitoring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the heart of both interventions is a short video that is shown twice
 to individual co-heads using tablet computers.
 The aim of the video is to increase viewers' knowledge of recommended practices
 in maize farming such as timely planting, row planting, and the use of
 improved inputs, primarily hybrid seed and inorganic fertilizer.
 It does this through an aspirational story in which a farmer (or farmers)
 recounts how he/she/they used to be poor but managed to increase yields
 over time by applying a set of recommended techniques and inputs.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The techniques and inputs that are demonstrated in the videos are the ones
 recommended by the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) and
 are also used by the public agricultural advisory system.
 More details can be found in [placeholder for reference removed for double
 blind review].
\end_layout

\end_inset

 It also suggests that farmers should view maize farming as a business that
 needs continuous investment over time, and includes some simple intertemporal
 cost-benefit calculations to illustrate this, followed by encouragements
 to follow the example of the model farmer(s) featured in the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first intervention, referred to as T1 in the remainder of the paper,
 involves varying the gender composition of the actors featured in the video
 and randomizing which version of the video is viewed by farmers.
 The second intervention, which we refer to as T2, randomly varies whether
 the video is viewed by the spouses jointly or by only one of the spouses.
 These variations and the rationale behind them are explained below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin with a conceptual explanation that ties to our first intervention
 (T1): projecting a cooperative image of farming as a household, thereby
 challenging the local consensus that maize farming is a male activity.
 Consider that within households, individual members often have differing
 spheres of influence reflecting prevailing gender roles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lundberg1993separate"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In many agricultural households, including in Uganda, women tend to have
 a stronger voice in the cultivation of crops that are predominately cultivated
 for home consumption, while men have a stronger voice in the cultivation
 of crops that are marketed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2010.536222"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 While the existence of such gendered patterns are widely acknowledged,
 they are not always easily captured in household survey data, as gender
 is only one of the determinants of crop portfolio choice 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "CARR2008900,DOSS20021987"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Uganda, maize, which is in part a cash crop, is considered to be mostly,
 though not exclusively, in the influence sphere of men 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2010.536222"

\end_inset

.
 Generally, men make the more strategic decisions such as which plots to
 plant maize on, when to start planting, and what seeds to use.
 Men also generally decide on how much labor is needed, while women assist
 men.
 In many situations, labor division in maize farming is organized according
 to gender roles, with men performing tasks such as land clearing and marketing
 of surplus output, while women perform weeding and post-harvest processing
 tasks.
 While these are broad and stylized characterizations of Uganda's maize
 production system, their widespread acceptance as conventional wisdom makes
 maize farming a topic ripe for this study.
 The fact that maize is not exclusively in the male domain provides scope
 to strengthen women's involvement in decision-making about maize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We expect that differing spheres of influence between male and female co-heads
 and the gendered division of labor may contribute to spousal disagreement
 in survey responses.
 Therefore, our first intervention randomly varies which version of our
 video is screened to our study participants.
 One version features a couple comprised of a male and a female actor-farmer
 who present themselves as role models to convey a world view in which both
 male and female co-heads participate equally in maize farming.
 Another version of the video features only a male actor-farmer.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A third version of the video features only a female actor, but is not used
 in this study.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This approach capitalizes on recent evidence exploring the influence of
 role models on aspirations, investment choices, and other future-oriented
 behaviors

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test the hypothesis that male and female co-heads disagree less if they
 view farming as a joint spousal activity, we randomly assign 261 households
 from our sample to view the cooperative image version of the video, such
 that both the male and female co-heads in the household watch the video
 together.
 This group functions as the treatment group.
 We also randomly assign 240 households from our sample to view the version
 of the video featuring only a male actor-farmer, again with both the male
 and female co-heads watching together.
 Because the only difference between the two videos is the gender composition
 of the actors featured (a couple of male and female actor-farmers versus
 a male actor), any difference in outcomes between the two groups should
 be attributed to the role model effect of the cooperative image intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we turn to our second hypothesis about asymmetric information within
 the household.
 Consider the farm-household as a collection of individuals, each with their
 own preferences, skills, assets, and access to resources, including knowledge.
 Information within households does not always flow friction less between
 household members, and so one member may not be cognizant of the full range
 of decisions made, activities undertaken or assets held by other members
 of the household.
 Furthermore, in many contexts, the household's existence and the welfare
 of its members depend on their collective capacity to invest in common
 goods by drawing on each individual's skills, assets, and resources.
 As such, households can be considered as collective action institutions,
 and many of the problems encountered in common pool resource management,
 such as free-riding and overextraction of resources, apply to the household
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doss2015collective"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 One way to attenuate collective action problems is by increasing mutual
 monitoring by making sure both spouses have access to the same information

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a second treatment (T2), we therefore ensure that both co-heads begin
 with symmetric information on recommended agronomic practices for maize
 farming, as this is assumed to facilitate mutual monitoring and directly
 reduce asymmetric information.
 To do so, we show the video that showcases recommended practices in maize
 farming to both male and female co-heads together in a random sample of
 261 households.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We show the version of the video that features a couple (male and female
 actor-farmers), that is, the video used in the treatment group of the previous
 intervention.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This group acts as the treatment group.
 In another random sample of 540 households, the control group, the same
 video is shown, but only to one of the two co-heads.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The reason why we have about double the number of households in the control
 group is due to the design of the experiment.
 The experiment was set up as a 3x3 factorial design to also test various
 other hypotheses (unrelated to survey response disagreement).
 For the second treatment we effectively pool two treatment cells to construct
 the control group: one treatment cell where only the male co-head was shown
 the video and one treatment cell where only the female co-head was shown
 the video.
 While statistical power is optimal in approximately equal sized samples
 in treatment and control, more observations increase precision.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 As the only difference between the two groups is related to who viewed
 the video (the male and female co-heads together versus an individual co-head),
 any difference in outcomes between the two groups should be attributed
 to a reduction in information asymmetries between co-heads.

 show that if random measurement error is the only factor leading to disagreemen
t, then disagreement should be symmetric: One would thus expect, for instance,
 that the likelihood that the female co-head says she was involved in a
 particular decision while the male co-head says she was not is about the
 same as the likelihood that the male co-head says the female co-head was
 involved in that decision, while the female co-head says she was not.
 Testing if disagreement between male and female co-heads is simply due
 to random measurement error is thus equivalent to testing if two proportions
 are significantly different from each other, which we will do using a Pearson

 They go on to explain that this could be due to differences in understanding
 or interpretation of the questions, or differences in perceptions of what
 it means to make a decision, what constitutes agricultural labor, or what
 it entails to own an asset.
 This type of disagreement is categorized as measurement error because it
 does not adequately reflect what happens in reality.

 disagreement about a spouse's role in decision making, labor provision,

 This is done by performing a series of t-tests that test for the equality

 argue that rejecting both types of measurement error indicates that disagreemen
t also partly reflects a real difference in what spouses know from each
 other, a situation they refer to as asymmetric information within the household.
 While they admit that some of this disagreement may be unintentional, they
 also note that the fact that disagreement seems to be highest among assets
 that are more easily hidden (small livestock, poultry, and small durables)
 suggests that at least part of this hiding is intentional.
 We provide an explicit test for the hypothesis that some disagreement is
 related to asymmetric information within the household by comparing average
 disagreement between co-heads in households that were exposed to the interventi
on designed to provide spouses with equal information (T2) to average disagreeme
nt between spouses in households that did not receive this intervention.
 This is done using the following OLS regression:

 the intervention and zero for the control group.
 We expect that providing both co-heads with the same information will lead
 to a reduction in disagreement, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, if disagreement is due to spouses hiding information from each
 other, we expect that providing both spouses with equal information would
 facilitating mutual monitoring.
 Furthermore, we would expect that the treatment would be relatively more
 effective for activities that are easier to hide.
 Following this line of reasoning, we define
\emph on

\emph default

 While

\end_inset

 consider this form of disagreement part of symmetric measurement error,
 we argued earlier that disagreement that arises from spouses responding
 in line with expectations may also lead to differing rates of disagreement
 between decisions or activities.
 For instance, disagreement stemming from spouses responding in line with
 expectations on the role of women in weeding may be very different from
 disagreement related to the role of women in land preparation.
 In the former case, as weeding is seen as a typical female activity, men
 may have no problems admitting that the female co-head did all the work.
 For the second case, as society expects men to do the often heavy work
 of land preparation, men may be more reluctant to disclose that their female
 co-head also spent considerable time on this task.
 This is in line with what

 areas where they are expected to bear final responsibility.

We thus test if part of the disagreement that 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Now, the treatment status of household

 video intervention projecting a cooperative approach to farming (T1), and

 to reduce disagreement

\begin_layout Standard
The study was conducted among monogamous maize-farming households in five
 districts of eastern Uganda, an area known for maize production.
 Participating households were recruited using a two-stage cluster sampling
 approach to obtain a representative sample of this population.
 Specifically, we first selected 50 parishes randomly and in proportion
 to the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we listed all households, and randomly selected 10
 households from the list to participate in the study.
 This resulted in an effective sample of 2,548 households.
 The interventions described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 were implemented in random subsets of this sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We focused on the second maize-growing season of 2017, which ran from about
 August 2017, when fields were prepared, to January 2018, when maize was
 harvested.
 Interventions were administered twice, once in August 2017 when farmers
 were preparing fields, and one month later during planting time.
 Concurrent with the first intervention in 2017, we also collected information
 on household characteristics.
 End-line data was collected after the harvest in February 2018.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to our baseline data, households in our study area cultivated
 on average about 1.5 plots of maize.
 Yields during the first season of 2017 were extremely low (about 270 kilograms
 per acre) as a result of a fall armyworm outbreak that significantly affected
 the maize crop.
 Baseline data indicated that the average household in our sample consisted
 of eight individuals.
 Female co-heads in these households were on average 35 years old and 30
 percent had completed their primary education.
 Male co-heads were on average 43 years old and 42 percent had completed
 their primary education.
 Only 11 percent of households reported that they had access to agricultural
 extension services in the year prior to our survey.
 Only 17 percent of households used fertilizer on at least one plot, and
 38 percent reported using improved seed bought from a shop or agro-input
 dealer during the last cropping season (April-July 2017).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first area in which we explore disagreement between male and female co-head
 is in decision-making related to maize farming.
 In our endline survey, we asked the male co-head of household to list all
 maize plots that the household was cultivating during the season preceding
 the endline survey (that is, the second agricultural season of 2017).
 We then cycled through the different plots and asked a series of questions
 for each plot, and repeated the same questions separately with the female
 co-head.
 For a range of key decisions that need to be made and that are known to
 significantly affect maize yields, we asked who made the decision on that
 particular plot.
 Respondents could answer that decisions were made by (1) the respondent
 himself or herself alone, (2) the respondent's spouse alone, (3) the respondent
 jointly with his or her spouse, (4) someone else inside or outside the
 respondent's household, (5) the respondent together with someone else inside
 or outside the household, or (6) the respondent's spouse together with
 someone else inside or outside the household.
 Respondents could also indicate that they did not know who made the decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first decision we consider is simply who decided that maize should be
 planted on the particular plot.
 A second decision relates to timing of planting, recognizing that planting
 date is a strong agronomic determinant of yields.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
NARO recommends that maize planting start immediately after the first rains
 of the season.
 This often results in significant time pressure on household members' labor
 time, especially when large areas need to be planted.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The third decision considers the spacing of seed and the seeding rate,
 which reflects the fact that row planting at a rate of one seed per mound
 is also a strong determinant of yield.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is a wide range of seed methods used by farmers in Uganda.
 While some simply broadcast seeds, NARO recommends row planting because
 it results in significantly higher yields since it reduces competition
 between plants for sunlight and soil nutrients.
 Farmers also often plant more than one seed per mound because they fear
 some seeds may not germinate.
 However, planting more than one seed per mound also tends to increase competiti
on for light and nutrients, leading to stunted plant growth.
 It is therefore recommended to use only one seed per mound and engage in
 gap filling when seeds do not germinate after one week.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We also consider decisions related to weed control.
 For weeding, we differentiate between decision-making related to strategies
 used to combat striga infestation (a parasitic weed that feeds off the
 roots of the maize plant) and weeding more generally.
 Finally, we look at decision-making related to maize marketing, and ask
 who took the decision to sell any part of the maize that was harvested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also collected detailed information on labor time.
 On each maize plot, we asked each co-head separately how much time, expressed
 in labor days over the entire agricultural season, he or she worked on
 a particular activity.
 We also asked each co-head to give an estimate of how much time the other
 co-head worked on the plot on that particular task.
 The activities we inquired about are land preparation, planting, weeding,
 spraying, and harvesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way in which we collected data about spouses’ labor time could have
 been subject to some limitations, that could have implications for symmetric
 measurement error as well as asymmetric measurement bias.
 Yet, as there is no reason to believe these challenges manifest differently
 in our respective treatment and control groups, there are no likely implication
s for the results of our experiments.
 The main issue relates to the stylized questions that each co-head was
 asked about total labor days spent on specific maize farming-related activities
 on specific maize plots during the previous maize-growing season.
 Their responses may have been subject to recall bias, particularly for
 less salient or irregular activities 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 If such activities are gender-specific, then this could have contributed
 to observed difference between male and female co-heads.
 There are also cognitive issues related to properly identifying the activity
 in question and remembering and aggregating all instances of labor spent
 on the particular activity, which is possibly variable over the reference
 period

key "doi:10.1080/13545701.2020.1749867"

 Gender differences in education levels and numeracy skills could have also
 induced gender-specific challenges with regard to the latter, with lower
 education levels associated with higher likelihood of overestimation in
 recall 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ARTHI2018160"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The reference period (the previous maize-growing season) is relatively
 long, thereby increasing the risk of recall bias and estimation based on
 established patterns of activity, yet, it is likely to be clear and salient
 for these maize farmers.
 Besides, the reference period is not likely to be subject to gender differences
 in correctly identifying it 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/13545701.2020.1749867"

 Seasonality bias is not likely given the season-specific nature of our
 experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the outcome variables and the treatment indicators, there
 are two additional variables in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 that require attention.
 First, to test if intentional hiding is the main cause for disagreement
 related to labor contributions, we construct an indicator (H2) of how easy
 it is for co-heads of households to monitor particular activities and actions.
 To do so, we asked 30 local experts to score each activity (eg.
 time spent on weeding) in terms of its ease of monitoring on a scale between
 zero and 100, with zero being impossible to find out the actions of one's
 co-head and 100 being very easy to find out.
 We only scored for labor contributions and not for decision-making, since
 the latter is extremely difficult to monitor.
 The indicator H2 takes a value of one for an activity of the average expert
 score was larger than 40, indicating that it is difficult to monitor; and
 zero otherwise.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We convert the indicator to a dummy to keep the analysis simple.
 The threshold was chosen to maximize variability.
 That is, we chose a cut-off such that we obtained approximately 50 percent
 of 1s and 50 percent of 0s.
 The results have proven not to be sensitive to conversion into a binary
 indicator nor the choice of the threshold for defining the binary indicator.
 The same is true for H1 below.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, to test if gender norms and customs are driving spousal disagreement,
 we also created an indicator (H1) for the extent to which a particular
 action or decision is culturally believed to be more in the male domain.
 This was done by asking the same 30 experts to indicate who, within the
 household, is typically expected to make the particular decision or perform
 a particular action.
 This was again scored on a scale running from zero (typically the female
 co-head alone) to 100 (typically the male co-head alone).
 The indicator H1 takes a value of one for an activity or decision if the
 average expert score is larger than 55, situating it in the male domain;
 and zero otherwise.

To investigate disagreement between responses from male and female co-heads
 about who made various decisions related to maize cultivation, we construct
 indicators based on the answers of both co-heads.
 To assess (dis)agreement about the role of the female co-head in decision-makin
g, we define three different categories: (1) both co-heads agree on the
 woman's role in decision making
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This includes cases where neither spouse says that the wife was involved

 Similarly, to assess (dis)agreement about the role of the the male co-head,
 the three categories are: (1) spouses agree on the man's role in decision-makin

 the female co-head says the male co-head was involved (either alone or

 Categories (2) and (3) can be pooled to obtain an indicator for disagreement

 The top panel shows that co-heads mostly agree on the female co-head's
 role in decision-making.
 Focusing on disagreement, we see that on the average plot the likelihood
 that the female co-head says she was involved in a particular decision
 but the male co-head disagrees (category 2) is always higher than the likelihoo

 and includes the indicator for the treatment that challenges norms and
 customs by projecting a cooperative approach to farming, the indicator
 for susceptibility of the decision to gender norms, and an interaction
 between the two.
 We see that the treatment still leads to a reduction in disagreement.
 However, and contrary to expectations, we do not find that the intervention
 reduced disagreement differently for decisions that are assumed to be in
 the male domain than for decisions that are culturally less strongly assigned
 to the male domain.
 This goes against our hypothesis that the change in disagreement in response
 to intervention T1 is mediated by gender norms and customs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom panel repeats the analysis, but the dependent variable is now
 an indicator for instances where the male co-head says he decided but the
 female co-head says he was not involved in the decision.
 As we saw earlier, disagreement about the male co-head's role is lower.
 The first column confirms that in the control group where households were
 not exposed to the intervention challenging norms and customs (T1), male
 co-heads claim a larger role than female co-heads admit in

 This percentage is not significantly different in the treatment group,
 which suggests that the role of men in agricultural decision-making is
 less socially contested.

In the second column, we do see that the intervention aimed at reducing
 information asymmetries (T2) reduced disagreement.
 In the control group where only one of the co-heads was shown a video on
 what maize farming entails, male co-heads report they were involved but
 the female co-head disagreed in

 percentage points.
 This suggests that male co-heads may hide decision-making from the female
 co-head, or that the female co-head is not aware of all the decisions that
 the male co-head makes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third column in the table shows no significant correlation between spousal
 disagreement related to the role of the male co-head and the indicator
 that attempts to measure how sensitive a decision is in terms of gender
 norms defining it as a male domain.
 Apparently, the likelihood that the male co-head reports he was involved
 while the female co-head claims he was not is significantly higher for
 decisions that were judged to be more in the male domain (specifically,
 the decisions to sell, plant maize, and fight striga) than for decisions
 that were seen less a responsibility for the man (the decision on when
 to weed).
 However, the statistically insignificant coefficient of the interaction
 term of the intervention challenging norms and customs and the indicator
 that captures if the decision is typically in the male domain in the fourth
 column again runs against the hypothesis that disagreement is driven by
 gender norms and customs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
labor Provision
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For labor contributions, we define the three categories of (dis)agreement
 as follows.
 A first category (1) consists of cases where there is agreement on a spouse's
 labor contribution.
 For disagreement, we differentiate between cases where (2) the co-head
 reported having spent more time on a particular task than the other co-head
 thinks they did, and (3) the co-head reported having spent less time than
 the other co-head thinks they did.
 Labor contribution (and hence disagreement about it) is also measured at
 the plot level.
 We consider disagreement related to labor provided by the female co-head
 and disagreement related to labor provided by the male co-head separately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above, we consider labor to be a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bad
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, with co-heads preferring to work less rather than more.
 The category of interest here is therefore category (3), where co-heads
 are putting in less hours than what the other co-head believes.
 The fact that one spouse is putting in less hours than the other spouse
 believes may suggest some level of shirking, but it may also be because
 one spouse is simply not aware of the full range of activities the other
 preforms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One complication here is that labor time is measured as a continuous variable
 (days spent on the activity), so it becomes necessary to define agreement
 or disagreement based on how close reported labour time estimates are.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It almost never happens that spouses completely agree on the number of days
 that a co-head worked on for example weeding, but some are very close (for
 instance 22 and 23 days).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Furthermore, there may be substantial differences in total number of days
 spent on the different activities.
 For example, for an activity such as spraying pesticides, female co-heads
 report that they spend on average only 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{desc[1]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 days.
 Female co-heads report that they spend considerably more time on weeding
 (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{desc[2]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 days).
 These differences in magnitude will also have consequences for the likelihood
 that co-heads agree, and it seems hard to argue that disagreement of one
 hour for spraying pesticides is directly comparable to disagreement of
 one hour in estimated time spent on weeding.
 We try to mitigate these problems by first standardizing hours worked for
 each activity, such that differences between spouses in reporting of days
 worked on, for example, weeding by a co-head become directly comparable
 to difference in estimates between spouses of time spent of a co-head on,
 for instance, spraying.
 Second, based on these standardized variables, we construct an indicator
 variable for agreement if estimates are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close enough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to each other.
 Specifically, if the labor time difference is within one standard deviation
 of the average time reported by male and female co-head, we consider there
 to be agreement.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A threshold of one standard deviation was chosen to make sure there are
 sufficient levels of disagreement, as it is well know that outcomes with
 limited variation contribute little power in experiments.
 However, we also reran the analysis with thresholds of 0.5 standard deviations
 and 1.5 standard deviations to show that the choice of the threshold does
 not affect our conclusions.
 Results are available from authors on request.

\begin_layout Standard
The top panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:agreement_labour"

\end_inset

 shows that co-heads again generally agree on the labor contribution of
 the female co-head.
 Agreement seems to be highest for the female co-head's role in spraying.
 This is not surprising because spraying pesticides involves carrying a
 heavy knapsack sprayer and handling dangerous substances, and is generally
 considered to be the responsibility of the male co-head in the household.
 As such, in most cases co-heads agree that the female co-head had no role
 in this activity.
 This is also reflected in scores of the experts, who overwhelmingly state
 this is a typical male task (87/100).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The table further shows that agreement is lowest for female co-head's labor
 provision in weeding, which the experts claim is predominantly a female
 task.
 Interestingly, we find a relatively high share of plots where the female
 co-head says she worked more than what the male co-head believes.
 But there are also instances where female co-heads claim they worked less
 than what the male co-head thinks, which may suggest shirking behavior.
 For example, on 15 percent of the plots, there are indications that the
 female co-head worked less on her weeding activities than what the male
 co-head believes.

-squared tests comparing rows 2 and 3 show that we reject equality of the
 two disagreement categories for all labor types, suggesting that disagreement
 on female co-heads' labor time is not caused by random measurement error
 alone.
 We also reject the null hypothesis that disagreement about the female co-head's
 labor contribution is equal across different labor categories, based on
 a Wald test after estimating equation

 This again indicates that discord can not be explained by cognitive differences
 between spouses alone (i.e., cognitive bias or asymmetric measurement error).

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom panel shows results for disagreement over the male co-head's
 labor contribution, which are similar to the results discussed above.
 Instances where the male co-head reports to be putting in less time than
 what the female co-head thinks are relatively high for labor allocated
 to spraying, a typical male activity that is also difficult to monitor
 according to our experts.
 Surprisingly, category 3 disagreement is equally high for weeding, a typically
 female task.

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we conduct a series of regressions to test if disagreement reflects
 information asymmetries with respect to labor contributions, or whether
 disagreement reflects norms and expectations about who, according to society,
 should do what activity.
 The top panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 reports results where the outcome variable is the proportion of activities
 on which the female co-head reports to have worked less than what the male
 co-head believes; the bottom panel reports on regressions where the dependent
 variable is the proportion of activities on which the male co-head report
 to have worked less than what the female co-head believes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As evidenced in the results in the upper panel, neither the intervention
 reducing information asymmetries (T2) nor the intervention challenging
 customs and norms (T1) seems to have an effect on the proportion of activities
 on which the female co-head reports to have worked less than what the male
 co-head believes.
 We find the proportion of activities on which the female co-head reports
 to have worked less than what the male co-head believes to be lower for
 activities that are considered in the male domain.
 More surprisingly, we also find that the proportion of activities on which
 the female co-head reports to have worked less than what the male co-head
 believes is lower for activities that are harder to monitor, which goes
 against the hypothesis that disagreement is due to the female co-head shirking.
 We do not find any significant interaction effects between the intervention
 challenging customs and norms and the indicator for male domain sensitivity.
 In the bottom panel, we also find no evidence that our interventions affect
 the likelihood that male co-heads report putting in less labor time than
 female co-heads believe.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Household surveys that are serious about capturing gender-related insights
 on intrahousehold decision-making, allocation of labor, and household assets
 often collect data from separate interviews with male and female respondents.
 This is an important means of reducing biases introduced by responses from
 the (typically male) household head or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

most knowledgeable person
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the household, and represents an important advancement in the study
 of intrahousehold power dynamics, especially in non-separable agricultural
 households where production and consumption decisions are so closely intertwine
d.
 A common finding in these surveys is that male and female co-heads often
 give substantially different answers to the same questions.
 While some discordance is inevitable due to random measurement error, recent
 studies have searched for patterns in this disagreement, and suggest that
 systematic disagreement between spouses may be key in understanding these
 intrahousehold dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and reject the notion that all disagreement between male and female co-heads
 in monogamous Ugandan maize-farming households is due to random measurement
 error or cognitive bias due to spouses differently understanding or interpretin
g the questions.
 We then test if discord is mainly driven by co-heads possessing only partly
 overlapping information sets, or if it is due to co-heads responding in
 line with what society expects from them given prevailing gender norms
 and roles.
 This is done through a field experiment, with one video-based intervention
 designed to provide co-heads with equal information and another video-based
 intervention designed to encourage spouses to view maize farming as a cooperati
ve or joint household enterprise rather than the domain of the male co-head
 (as society tends to).
 We explore possible impact pathways by looking at conditional average treatment
 effects, as we expect that the interventions would be most effective for
 decisions, activities and assets that are easier to hide or more susceptible
 to gender norms and customs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that co-heads generally agree with each other.
 Disagreement can not be fully explained by either random measurement error
 or cognitive bias alone.
 Rather, we find that disagreement about the role of the female co-head
 in decision-making was reduced after co-heads were exposed to our intervention
 designed to reduce the influence of gender norms and customs.
 We also find that disagreement about the role of both male and female co-heads
 in decision-making reduced in response to our intervention designed to
 reduce information asymmetry.
 We did not find that the intervention designed to reduce the influence
 of gender norms and customs was more effective for decisions that are considere
d to be more in the male domain.
 When looking at disagreement related to labor contributions of the female
 and male co-heads respectively, we did not find that the intervention designed
 to increase reduce information disadvantages of one spouse had an impact,
 nor that activities that are more easily hidden are more likely to result
 in disagreement as would be the case when shirking.
 We also did not find that the intervention challenging role congruity,
 gender norms and customs made a difference, or more so for activities defined
 as typical male tasks according to gender norms and roles.
