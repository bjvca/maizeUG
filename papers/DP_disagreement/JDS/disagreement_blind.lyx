\begin_layout Title
Hiding, Shirking or Pleasing: Spousal Disagreement among Ugandan Maize Farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To gain a better understanding of intrahousehold bargaining processes, surveys
 increasingly collect data from co-heads individually, especially on decision
 making, asset ownership and labour contributions.
 However, answers provided by co-heads on the same set of questions often
 differ substantially.
 Recent research suggests that, while some of this disagreement is due to
 random measurement error and cognitive bias, co-heads also seem to hide
 information from each other.
 In this paper, we document differences in answers between male and female
 co-heads in monogamous smallholder maize farming households in eastern
 Uganda.
 We first confirm that not all disagreement can be explained by measurement
 error or bias.
 Using a field experiment, we then test if disagreement is due to co-heads
 strategically hiding decisions and actions from each other.
 We also test an alternative explanation where discord is attributed to
 co-heads' tendency to respond in line with prevailing gender norms and
 customs in society.
 While the interventions did seem to reduce discord in survey response about
 about decision making, we do not find that decision hiding nor reporting
 in line with gender norms and customs are the primary drivers.

 Examples of best practice in data collection on intrahousehold decision-making
 processes include separate interviewing of male and female co-heads of
 (dual-headed) households using distinct survey instruments that may nonetheless
 contain common topics and questions.
 Studies using these instruments often find that co-heads provide different
 answers on even the most basic questions

 demonstrate that, while part of these divergent responses may be attributable
 to measurement error, there is also a systematic component that reflects
 asymmetric information within households where one co-head does not have
 accurate knowledge about the decisions made, actions taken, or assets owned
 by the other.
 Furthermore, they argue that the fact that disagreement is larger for assets
 and decisions that are easier to hide may indicate that spouses strategically
 hiding information from each other.
 A number of lab-in-the-field experiments similarly confirm that household
 members often conceal some of their resources

In this paper, we investigate spousal disagreement in survey response among

 Drawing on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, we explore the same three types of explanation for discordâ€”random measurement
 error, bias caused by men and women interpreting questions differently,
 and asymmetric information where men and women have only partly overlapping
 information sets.
 However, we go one step further and, using a field experiment, formally
 test if this asymmetric information between husband and wives should be
 attributed to spouses strategically hiding information from each other.
 This is done by randomly assigning a sample of households to a video based
 intervention designed to facilitate mutual monitoring and comparing spousal
 disagreement to a control group.
 Furthermore, we test for an alternative explanation, where discord is not
 the result of asymmetric information, but is caused by spouses answering
 in line with prevailing gender norms in society.
 Inspired by recent research on the use of role models to change attitudes
 and behaviour in traditionally male dominated sectors, we test the impact
 of a video based intervention that promotes a mental image of maize farming
 as a cooperative or joint venture in which both spouses play an equal role
 in maize farming

\begin_layout Standard
We consider spousal disagreement with respect to the role of both female
 and male co-heads in decision making and labour provision.
 For disagreement about the female co-head's role in decision making, the
 focus is on hiding, defined as the likelihood that the female co-head reports
 she was involved in decision making but the male co-head says she was not.
 For disagreement about the male co-head's role role in decision making,
 we consider the likelihood that the male co-head reports he was involved
 in the decision but the female co-head says he was not.
 For labour provision, we focus on shirking, defined as instances where
 the one co-head reports to have worked less than what the other co-head
 thinks.
 We shirking by both female and male co-head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that measurement error alone can not explain observed spousal disagreeme
nt in survey responses.
 We also reject that differences in how male and female co-heads interpret
 the questions is the main driver for observed disagreement.
 For decision making, we find that both interventions significantly reduce
 disagreement about the role of the female co-head.
 Disagreement about the role of the male co-head is only reduced by the
 video based intervention that is assumed to facilitate mutual monitoring.
 However, further inquiry into the impact pathways do not allow us to determine
 the exact mechanisms for the impact.
 The interventions do not affect disagreement related to labour provision.

\begin_layout Section
Literature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our review of prior work on spousal disagreement focuses mainly on the empirical
 literature on intrahousehold resource allocation and decision-making in
 (dual-headed) agricultural households in low and middle income countries,
 and draws primarily on analyses that use observational data from surveys
 in which both male and female co-heads are interviewed separately and are
 asked the same set of questions.
 Such studies often focus on research questions related to women's empowerment
 and autonomy.
 For example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1728-4465.2002.00299.x"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 asks both co-heads questions on the locus of decision-making on a variety
 of issues, as well as specific questions concerning women's mobility and
 access to resources.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 collect data from both co-heads on a range of autonomy items, including
 the need of the female co-head to obtain the male co-head's permission
 to go to different types of places, the female co-head's capacity to decide
 on their children's affairs, whether the female co-head is allowed to have
 a job, and her role in deciding on the number of children and household
 expenditure-related decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common finding in studies that ask the same set of questions to different
 individuals within the household is that substantial disagreement often
 arises between co-heads, even on questions that would seem easily and objective
ly verifiable, such as the number of children, or type of material used
 for house construction.
 This divergence may simply be attributable to measurement error by the
 respondents.
 But 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggest that such divergence may also partly be due to the fact that the
 response categories do not have the same cognitive or semantic meanings
 to women and men.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "SEYMOUR201897"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 note that co-heads often give inconsistent answers when asked about who
 made a particular decision.
 They then test whether female unilateral decision-making is equally empowering
 if the male co-head disagrees that the woman took the decision alone, as
 compared to when the male co-head agrees.
 They conclude that disagreement may signal underlying power dynamics within
 the household that are likely to be relevant when assessing individual-level
 agency and empowerment.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANNAN2021105292"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 similarly look at underlying power dynamics, focusing in particular on
 cases where the female co-head reported she made decisions, while the male
 co-head said the female co-head was not involved.
 They refer to this type of disagreement as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

women taking power
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and show that it is positively correlated with a range of outcomes for
 women and children.
 They conclude that more research is needed to establish causality and identify
 which interventions affect disagreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"

\end_inset

 provide a particularly insightful conceptual framework that teases out
 the various perspectives on spousal disagreement.
 First, they note that if disagreement solely derives from measurement error,
 disagreement should be symmetric, and the female co-head's responses should
 not differ systematically from the male co-head's responses.
 Second, they point out that if disagreement results from asymmetric measurement
 error in which men and women interpret questions differently (as suggested
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANDERSON2017169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), then answers should differ systematically between co-heads, but disagreement
 should be similar for different questions asked in a survey (or at least
 for a sets of similar questions like questions related to asset ownership
 or different decisions).
 Finally, they argue that finding differing rates of disagreement across
 survey questions, and higher rates of disagreement for assets and activities
 that are easier to hide in particular, points to the presence of intrahousehold
 information asymmetries.
 Using observational data collected in Bangladesh, they find evidence that
 such information asymmetries in the form of hidden assets and decisions
 are present in their sampled households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, we feel that differential disagreement on different decisions,
 asset categories, or activities need not always reflect the act of one
 co-head intentionally deceiving another.
 There may be other reasons why spouses agree more in one area and less
 in another area.
 One reason may be that spouses respond in line with what society expects
 from them, such that disagreement related to decisions, actions and asset
 ownership is also partly shaped by prevailing gender stereotypes and norms.
 For example, in a case study in northern Uganda, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that men often report unilateral decision-making in areas where they
 are assumed to bear final responsibility, even if women had some degree
 of involvement.
 Women rather report these scenarios as joint decisions.
 Hence, it is important to understand the local cultural context to differentiat
e spousal disagreement as a function of information asymmetries stemming
 from intentional hiding versus other gender-related systematic biases.

\begin_layout Section
Experimental design and interventions
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to random error and cognitive bias due to spouses in interpreting
 questions differently, the previous section shows that the emerging literature
 on spousal disagreement in survey response suggests two potential mechanisms.
 First, spousal disagreement may be due to cultural context in which these
 questions are asked and answered, with co-heads responding in line with
 what would be expected in society 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Second, the literature also suggests that spousal disagreement reflects
 information asymmetries between co-heads, predominantly cause by co-heads
 hiding decisions, actions and assets from each other 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We designed two corresponding interventions to empirically test these two
 explanations in a field experiment.
 A first intervention attempts to challenge preconceived ideas of what decision
 making by a male or female co-head involves and who is expected to make
 decisions in a farm household by promoting a cooperative approach to maize
 farming, in which maize cultivation and management activities are seen
 as a joint responsibility of both co-heads.
 A second intervention tests if these asymmetries can be influenced by providing
 co-heads equal access to information about best practices in maize farming
 prior to the point in time when decisions are made on cultivation and managemen
t, as this would facilitate mutual monitoring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the heart of both interventions is a short video that is shown twice
 to individual co-heads within households using tablet computers.
 The aim of the video is to increase viewers' knowledge of recommended practices
 in maize farming, such as timely planting, row planting, and the use of
 improved inputs such hybrid seed and inorganic fertilizer.
 It does this through an aspirational story in which a farmer (or farmers)
 recounts how he/she/they used to be poor but managed to increase yields
 over time by applying a set of techniques and inputs.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The techniques and inputs that are demonstrated in the videos are the ones
 recommended by the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) and
 are also used by the public agricultural advisory system.
 More details can be found in [placeholder for reference removed for double
 blind review].
\end_layout

\end_inset

 It also suggests that farmers view maize farming as a business that needs
 continuous investment over time and includes some simple intertemporal
 cost-benefit calculations to illustrate this, followed by encouragements
 to follow the example of the model farmer(s) featured in the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first intervention, referred to as T1 in the remainder of the paper,
 involves varying the gender composition of the actors featured in the video
 and randomizing which version of the video is viewed by farmers.
 The second intervention, which we will refer to as T2, randomly varies
 the gender composition of the co-head(s) of the household who view the
 video.
 These variations and the rationale behind them are explained below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin with a conceptual explanation that ties to our first intervention
 (T1): projecting a cooperative way of farming as a household, thereby challengi
ng the local consensus that maize farming is a male activity.
 Consider that within households, individual members often have differing
 spheres of influence reflecting prevailing gender roles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lundberg1993separate"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In many agricultural households, including in Uganda, women tend to have
 a stronger voice in the cultivation of crops that are predominately cultivated
 for home consumption, while men have a stronger voice in the cultivation
 of crops that are marketed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2010.536222"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 While the existence of such gendered patterns are widely acknowledged,
 they are not always easily captured in household survey data, as gender
 is only one of the determinants of crop portfolio choice 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
In Uganda, maize, which is in part a cash crop, is considered to be mostly,
 though certainly not exclusively, in the influence sphere of men 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2010.536222"

\end_inset

.
 Generally, men make the ore strategic decisions such as what plots to plant
 maize on, when to start planting, and what seeds to use.
 Men also generally decide on how much labor is needed, while women assist
 men.
 Labor division in maize farming, in many cases, is organised according
 to gender roles, with men taking up tasks such as land clearing and marketing,
 and women weeding and post-harvest processing.
 While these are broad and stylized characterizations of Uganda's maize
 production system, their widespread acceptance as conventional wisdom makes
 maize farming a topic ripe for this study.
 The fact that maize is not entirely an exclusive men domain provides scope
 to strengthen women's involvement in decision making about maize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We expect differing spheres of influence between male and female co-heads
 and gendered labor division may contribute to spousal disagreement in survey
 response.
 Therefore, our first intervention randomly varies which version of our
 video is screened to our study participants.
 One version features a couple of male and female actor-farmers who present
 themselves as role models to promote a worldview where both male and female
 co-heads participate equally in maize farming, while another version features
 only a male actor-farmer.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 This approach capitalizes on recent evidence on the influence that role
 models can have on aspirations, investment choices, and other future-oriented
 behaviors

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test the hypothesis that male and female co-heads disagree less if they
 view farming as a joint spousal activity, we randomly assign 261 households
 from our sample to be shown the cooperative image version of the video
 where co-heads participate equally in maize farming, such that both the
 male and female co-heads in the household watch the video together.
 This group functions as the treatment group.
 We also randomly assign 240 households from our sample to be shown the
 version of the video featuring only a male actor-farmer, again with both
 the male and female co-heads watching together.
 Because the only difference between the two videos is the gender composition
 of the actors featured (a couple of male and female actor-farmers versus
 a male actor), any difference in outcomes between the two groups should
 be attributed to the role model effect of the cooperative image intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we turn to our second hypothesis that relates to asymmetric information
 within the household.
 Consider the farm household as a collection of individuals, each with their
 own preferences, skills, assets, and access to resources.
 In many contexts, the household's existence and the welfare of its members
 depend on their collective capacity to invest in common goods by drawing
 on each individual's skills, assets, and resources.
 As such, households can be considered as informal institutions, and many
 of the problems encountered in common pool resource management and collective
 action, such as free-riding and overextraction of resources, apply to the
 household 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doss2015collective"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way in which collective action problems can be attenuated is through
 increased mutual monitoring 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "AGRAWAL20011649"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, if one co-head can assess the actual time that the other
 co-head spends on land preparation, then the latter is less likely to engage
 in labor shirking.
 However, for mutual monitoring to work, co-heads require information against
 which to compare information gained through monitoring, since merely observing
 an outcome may be insufficient to determine if a co-head is shirking, hiding,
 or otherwise mismanaging his or her collective obligations to the household.
 For instance, it may be difficult for the female co-head to check if her
 spouse overreports time spent preparing the field if she does not have
 a good understanding of what land preparation entails.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a second treatment (T2), we therefore make sure both co-heads start off
 with symmetric information with respect to recommended agronomic practices
 for maize farming, as this is assumed to facilitate mutual monitoring.
 To do so, we show the video that showcases recommended practices in maize
 farming to both male and female co-heads together in a random sample of
 261 households.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We show the version of the video that features a couple (male and female
 actor-farmers), that is, the video used in the treatment group of the previous
 intervention.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This group acts as the treatment group.
 In another random sample of 540 households, the control group, the same
 video is shown, but only to one of the two co-heads.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We made sure that in about half of the cases the video was shown to the
 male co-head alone and in the other half of cases to the female co-head
 alone.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 As the only difference between the two groups is related to whom the video

 any difference in outcomes between the two groups should be attributed
 to reducing information asymmetry between co-heads.

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we outline the different hypothesis and how they will be
 tested.
 While the focus will be on testing the impact of the interventions on spousal
 disagreement, we also use our data to test for random error and cognitive
 bias (due to spouses interpreting questions differently) using the framework
 outline in

\begin_layout Standard
A first hypothesis we will test is that disagreement between husband and
 wife is simply due to random noise.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"

\end_inset

 show that if random measurement error is the only factor leading to disagreemen
t, then disagreement should be symmetric.
 In such case, one would expect, for instance, that the likelihood that
 the female co-head says she was involved in a particular decision while
 the male co-head says she was not is about the same as the likelihood that
 the male co-head says the female co-head was involved in that decision,
 while the female co-head says she was not.
 Testing if disagreement between male and female co-head is simply due to
 random measurement error is thus equivalent to testing if two proportions
 are significantly different from each other, which we will do using a Pearson

Once it is established that disagreement can not be fully explained by random
 noise alone,

 They define asymmetric measurement error as

...measurement error that occurs systematically and leads to different patterns
 of responses for men and women
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (p.

 They go on to explain that this could be due to differences in understanding
 or interpretation of the questions, or differences in perceptions of what
 it means to make a decision, what constitutes agricultural labour, or what
 it entails to own an asset.
 This type of disagreement is categorized as measurement error because it
 does not adequately reflect what happens in reality.

 test for asymmetric measurement error by checking if the probability of
 disagreement about a spouse's role in decision making, labour provision,
 or marketing, is equal across the various decisions and activities under
 consideration.
 This is done by performing a series of t-tests that test for the equality
 of disagreement between pairs of decisions or asset holdings.
 We employ a more principled

 approach, where we use a Wald test for joint significance (using a cluster

 Test).
 In particular, we start from the following equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{i,d}=\alpha_{d}+\varepsilon_{i,d}\label{eq:f_test}
\end{equation}

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We will refer to decision making here to keep the exposition simple, but
 in the analysis we also consider disagreement between spouses on labour
 contributions.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We then test the joint null hypothesis that disagreement levels are equal
 across decisions, which amounts to constraining the intercepts 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\alpha_{d}\right)$
\end_inset

 to be equal to each other.
 If we reject the null, this means that disagreement about decision making
 between spouses cannot be fully explained by asymmetric measurement error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note the implicit assumption that asymmetric measurement
 error has its origin at the level of the individuals within the household
 (for example the female co-head has lower education leading her to systematical
ly underestimate effort), and so should not lead to heterogeneity within
 the household.
 Therefore, instead of referring to this as asymmetric measurement error,
 we see this more as bias caused by factors that emanate from the individual
 level.
 Generally, this individual level variation will manifest itself in differing
 cognitive capacities of co-heads and difference in how questions are interprete
d by male and female co-head 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Obviously, this can also be affected by cultural factors,

 by cultural factors that lead to men under-reporting women's roles.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 but gender norms and customs also create variance at the level of the different
 decisions and activities, which we exploit to provide an explicit test
 below (equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In this paper, we will refer to this type of disagreement as cognitive
 bias, rather than categorizing this as a type of measurement error.

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

 argue that rejecting both types of measurement error indicates that disagreemen
t reflects a real difference in what spouses know from each other, a situation
 they refer to as asymmetric information within the household.
 While they admit that some of this disagreement may be unintentional, they
 also note that the fact that disagreement seems to be highest among assets
 that are more easily hidden (small livestock, poultry, and small durables)
 suggests that at least part of this hiding is strategic.
 We provide an explicit test for the hypothesis that some disagreement is
 related to asymmetric information within the household by comparing average
 disagreement between co-heads in households that were exposed to the interventi
on designed to facilitate mutual monitoring (T2) to average disagreement
 between spouses in households that did not receive this intervention.
 This is done using the following OLS regression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{i,d}=\alpha+\beta.T_{i}+\varepsilon_{i,d}\label{eq:ATE}
\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}$
\end_inset

 denotes the treatment status of household 
\emph on
i
\emph default
, which is a dummy that takes the value of one for households that received
 the intervention and zero for the control group.
 We expect that providing both co-heads with information that facilitates
 mutual monitoring will lead to a reduction in disagreement, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, if disagreement is due to strategically hiding, we expect that
 facilitating mutual monitoring would be most effective for decisions that
 are easier to hide.
 Following this line of reasoning, we define
\emph on
 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{d}$
\end_inset


\emph default
, a measure of how easy it is to hide decision making related to

We mentioned earlier that disagreement may also result from spouses responding

 While 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 consider this form of disagreement part of symmetric measurement error,
 we argued earlier that disagreement that arises from spouses responding
 in line with expectations may differ between different decisions that are
 made within the household.
 For instance, disagreement between co-heads on the role of women in weeding
 may be very different from disagreement related to the role of women in
 land preparation.
 In the former case, as weeding is seen as a typical female activity, men
 may have no problems admitting that their female co-head did all the work.
 For the latter case, as society expects men to do the often heavy work
 of preparing the fields, men may be more reluctant to disclose that their
 female co-head also spent considerable time on this task.
 This is in line with what 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 find in in northern Uganda, where men often exaggerate their own role in
 areas where they are expected to bear final responsibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We thus test if part of the disagreement that 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Now, the treatment status of household 
\emph on

, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}$

, is a dummy that takes the value of one if spouses were exposed to the
 video intervention projecting a cooperative approach to farming as a household
 by showing a male-female couple role model (T1), and zero if a video was
 shown where only a male actor-farmer featured in the video.
 If cultural norms indeed drive disagreement, we expect the intervention
 to reduce disagreement 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\beta<0\right)$
\end_inset

.
 For this hypothesis, we also define
\emph on

a measure indicating whether the man within the household is deemed responsible

 We also interact

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study was conducted among monogamous maize-farming households in five
 districts in eastern Uganda, an area known for its maize production.
 Households that participated in the study were recruited using a two-stage
 cluster sampling approach to obtain a representative sample of this population.
 Specifically, we first selected 50 parishes randomly and in proportion
 to the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all households, and in each village
 we sampled 10 households to be included in the study.
 This resulted in an effective sample of 2,548 households.
 The interventions described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Experimental-design-and"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 were implemented in random subsets of this sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We focused on the second maize-growing season of 2017, which ran from about
 August 2017, when fields were prepared, to January 2018, when maize was
 harvested.
 Interventions were administered twice, once in August 2017 when farmers
 were preparing fields, and one month later during planting time.
 Concurrent with the first intervention in 2017, we also collected information
 on household characteristics and on the previous harvest, which was the
 first harvesting season of 2017.
 End-line data was collected after the harvest in February 2018.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to baseline data, farming households in our study area cultivated
 on average about 1.5 plots of maize.
 Yields during the first season of 2017 were extremely low (about 270 kilograms
 per acre) as a result of a Fall Armyworm outbreak that significantly affected
 the maize crop.
 Baseline data indicated that the average household in our sample consisted
 of 8 individuals.
 Female co-heads in these households were on average 35 years old and 30
 percent have finished primary education.
 Male co-heads are on average 43 years old and 42 percent have finished
 primary education.
 Only 11 percent of households reported that they had access to agricultural
 extension in the year prior to the survey.
 Only 17 percent of households used fertilizer on at least one plot, and
 38 percent reported using improved seed bought from a shop or agro-input
 dealer during the last cropping season (April-July 2017).
 About three quarters of households reported owning a mobile phone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first area in which we explore disagreement between male and female co-head
 is in decision making related to maize farming.
 In our endline survey, we asked the male co-head of household to list all
 maize plots that the household was cultivating during the season preceding
 the endline survey (that is, the second agricultural season of 2017).
 We then cycled through the different plots and asked a series of questions
 for each plot, and repeated the same questions separately with the female
 co-head.
 For a range of key decisions that need to be made and that are known to
 significantly affect maize yields, we asked who made the decision on that
 particular plot.
 Respondents could answer that decisions were made by (1) the respondent
 him- or herself alone, (2) the respondent's spouse alone, (3) the respondent
 jointly with his or her spouse, (4) someone else inside or outside the
 respondent's household, (5) the respondent together with someone else inside
 or outside the household, or (6) the respondent's spouse together with
 someone else inside or outside the household.
 Respondents could also indicate that they did not know who made the decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first decision we consider is simply who decided that maize should be
 planted on the particular plot.
 A second decision is related to timing of planting, recognizing that planting
 date is a strong agronomic determinant of yields.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
NARO recommends that maize planting start immediately after the first rains
 of the season.
 This often results in significant time pressure on household members' labor
 time, especially when large areas need to be planted.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The third decision relates to the spacing of seed and the seeding rate,
 which reflects the fact that row planting at a rate of one seed per mound
 is also a strong determinant of yield.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is a wide range of seed methods used by farmers in Uganda.
 While some simply broadcast seeds, NARO recommends row planting because
 it results in significantly higher yields since it reduces competition
 between plants for sunlight and soil nutrients.
 Farmers also often plant more than one seed per hill because they fear
 some seeds may not germinate.
 However, planting more than one seed per hill also tends to increase competitio
n for light and nutrients, leading to stunted plant growth.
 It is therefore recommended to use only one seed per hill and engage in
 gap filling when seeds do not germinate after one week.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We also consider decisions related to weed control.
 For weeding, we differentiate between decision making related to strategies
 used to combat striga infestation (a parasitic weed that feeds off the
 roots of the maize plant) and weeding more generally.
 Finally, we look at decision making related to maize marketing, and ask
 who sold took the decision to sell (part of the) maize that was harvested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also collected detailed information on labor time.
 On each maize plot, we asked each co-head separately how much time, expressed
 in labor days over the entire agricultural season, he or she worked on
 a particular activity.
 We also asked each co-head to give an estimate of how much time the other
 co-head worked on the plot on that particular task.
 The activities we inquired about are land preparation, planting, weeding,
 spraying, and harvesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the outcome variables and the treatment indicators, there
 are two additional important variables in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:CATE"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 First, to test if strategic hiding is the main cause for disagreement,
 we also construct an indicator (H2) of how easy it is for co-heads of household
s to monitor particular decisions, activities or actions.
 To do so, we asked 30 local experts to score each activity (eg.
 time spent to weeding) in terms of ease of monitoring on a scale between
 zero and 100, with zero being impossible to find out actions of one's co-head
 and 100 being very easy to find out.
 We only scored labour contributions, as we thought decision making is very
 hard to monitor anyway.
 The indicator H2 takes the value one for an activity or decision if the
 average expert score is larger than 40 indicating that it is difficult
 to monitor; and zero otherwise.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We convert the indicator to a dummy to keep the analysis simple.
 While the threshold may seem arbitrary, it was chosen to maximize variability.
 However, results were not sensitive to the choice of the threshold or even
 conversions into a binary indicator.
 The same is true for H1 below.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, to test if gender norms and customs are driving spousal disagreement,
 we also created an indicator (H1) for the extent to which a particular
 action or decision is culturally believed to be more in the male domain.
 This was done by asking the same 30 experts to indicate who, within the
 household, is typically (i.e.
 by prevailing norms and customs) expected to make the particular decision
 (e.g.
 the decision on what seed spacing and seed rate to use) or perform a particular
 action (e.g.
 weeding).
 This was again scored on a scale running from zero (typically the female
 co-head alone) to 100 (typically the male co-head alone).
 The indicator H1 takes the value one for an activity or decision if the
 average expert score is larger than 55 situating it in the male domain;
 and zero otherwise.

Decision making

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate disagreement between answers reported by male and female
 co-heads about who within the household made various decisions related
 to maize cultivation, we construct various indicators based on answers
 of both co-heads.
 To assess (dis)agreement about the role of the female co-head in decision
 making, we define three different categories: (1) both co-heads agree on
 the woman's role in decision making
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This includes cases where neither spouse says that the wife was involved
 in decision making as well as cases where both spouses say that the wife
 was involved in decision making (either alone or as part of the couple).

; (2) the female co-head says that she was involved (either alone or jointly
 with the male co-head), but the male co-head says she was not; and (3)
 the male co-head says the female co-head was involved (either alone or
 as part of the couple), but the female co-head says she was not.

 Similarly, to assess (dis)agreement about the role of the the male co-head,
 the three categories are: (1) spouses agree on the man's role in decision
 making; (2) the male co-head says that he was involved (either alone or
 jointly with the female co-head), but the female co-head says he was not;
 and (3) the female co-head says the male co-head was involved (either alone
 or as part of the couple), but the male co-head says he was not.
 Categories (2) and (3) can be pooled to obtain an indicator for disagreement
 on the involvement in decision making of the co-head.

The bottom panel shows that spouses agree even more about the role of the
 male co-head in decision making.
 Looking into disagreement, the likelihood that the male co-head claims
 he was involved in the decision and the female co-head disagrees is now
 always higher than the likelihood that the female co-head says the male
 co-head was involved but the male co-head says he was not.

 that we reject the null of random measurement error.
 Comparing disagreement about the role of the husband across different decision

 The outcome variable

 and includes both the indicator for the treatment that challenges role
 congruity by projecting a cooperative approach to farming by male-female
 couple role model, the indicator for susceptibility of the decision to
 gender norms, and an interaction between the two.
 We see that the treatment still leads to reduction in disagreement.
 However, and contrary to expectations, we do also not find that the interventio
n reduced disagreement differently for decisions that are assumed to be
 in the male domain than for decisions that are culturally less strongly
 assigned to the male domain.
 This goes against our hypothesis that the change in disagreement in response
 to the intervention T1 is mediated by gender norms and customs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom panel repeats the analysis, but the dependent variable is now
 an indicator for instances where the male co-head says he decided but the
 female co-head says he was not involved in the decision.
 As we saw earlier, disagreement about the male co-head's role is lower;
 the first column confirms that in the control group where households were
 not exposed to the intervention that attempts to challenge role congruity
 (T1), in

 percent of decisions male co-heads claim a larger role than female co-heads
 admit.
 This percentage is not significantly different in the treatment group,
 which suggests that the role of men in agricultural decision making is
 less socially contested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second column, we do see that the intervention aimed at facilitating
 mutual monitoring (T2) reduced disagreement.
 In the control group where only one of the co-heads was shown a video on
 what maize farming entails, male co-heads report they were involved but
 the female co-head disagreed in

 percentage points.
 This suggests that also male co-heads may hide decision making from the
 female co-head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third column in the table shows that we find significant correlation
 between spousal disagreement related to the role of the male co-head and
 the indicator that attempts to measure how sensitive a decision is in terms
 of gender norms defining it as a male domain.
 Apparently, the likelihood that the male co-head reports he was involved
 while the female co-head claims he was not is significantly higher for
 decisions that were judged to be more in the male domain (the decision
 to sell, decision to plant maize, and decision to fight striga) than for
 decisions that were seen less a responsibility for the man (decision on
 when to weed).
 However, the statistically insignificant coefficient of the interaction
 term of the intervention challenging role congruity and the indicator that
 captures if the decision is typically in the male domain in the fourth
 column again rejects the hypothesis that this disagreement is driven by
 gender norms and customs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Labour Provision
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For labour contributions, we define the three categories of (dis)agreement
 as follows: A first category (1) consists of cases where there is agreement
 on the female co-head's labour contribution.
 For disagreement, we differentiate between cases where (2) the female co-head
 reported to have spend more time on a particular task than the male co-head
 thinks she spent on it and (3) the female co-head reported spending less
 time than the male co-head thinks.
 Labour contribution (and hence disagreement about it) is also measured
 at the plot level.
 As for decision making, we consider disagreement related to the labour
 provided by the female co-head and disagreement related to labour provided
 by the male co-head separately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above, we consider labour to be a bad, with co-heads preferring
 to work less rather than more.
 The category of interest here is therefore category (3), where co-heads
 are shirking on their responsibilities, putting in less hours than what
 the other co-head thinks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One complication here is that labour time is measured as a continuous variable:
 days spent on the activity.
 As a result, the margin of error will also depend on the activity.
 For example, for an activity such as spraying of insecticides, fungicides
 or herbicides, female co-heads report that they spend on average only 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{desc[1]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 days.
 Female co-heads report that they spend considerably more time on weeding
 (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{desc[2]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 days).
 These differences in magnitude will also have consequences for the likelihood
 that co-heads agree.
 For instance, in the former case, there is agreement about the female co-head's
 labour time contribution on 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{desc[3]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of plots, while for weeding, this is only the case on 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{desc[4]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of plots.
 We try to mitigate this problem by defining agreement in relation to the
 underlying variable, indicating that there is agreement if estimates are
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close enough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to each other.
 In particular, if labour time difference is within one standard deviation
 of the average time reported by male and female co-head , we consider there
 is agreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The top panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:agreement_labour"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that co-heads again generally agree about the labour contribution
 of the female co-head.
 Agreement seems to be highest for the female co-head's role in spraying.
 This is not surprising because spraying insecticides, fungicides and herbicides
 involves carrying a heavy knapsack sprayer and handling of dangerous substances
, and is generally considered to be the responsibility of the male co-head
 in the household.
 As such, in most cases co-heads agree that the female co-head had no role
 in this activity.
 This is also reflected in scores of the experts, who overwhelmingly state
 this is a typical male task (87/100).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The table further shows that agreement is lowest for female co-head's labour
 provision in weeding, which the experts claim is predominantly a female
 task.
 Interestingly, we find a relatively high share of plots where the female
 co-head says she worked more than what the male co-head thinks.
 But there are also signs of shirking behaviour.
 For example, on 15 percent of the plots, there are indications that the
 female co-head shirks on her weeding activities (i.e.
 male co-head says female co-head worked more than female co-head admits).

-squared tests comparing rows 2 and 3 show that we reject equality of the
 two disagreement categories for all labour types, suggesting that disagreement
 on female co-heads' labour time is not caused by random measurement error
 alone.
 We also find that we reject the null hypothesis that disagreement about
 the female co-head's labour contribution is equal across different labour
 categories, judged by a Wald test after estimating equation

 This again means that discord cannot be explained by cognitive differences
 between spouses alone (i.e.
 cognitive bias or asymmetric measurement error).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom panel shows results of disagreement about the male co-head's
 labour contribution.
 Agreement seems to be similar to agreement about the female co-head's labour
 contribution.
 Shirking by the male co-head, where the female co-head says male co-head
 worked more than male co-head admits, is relatively high for labour provided
 for spraying, a typical male activity that is also difficult to monitor.
 Surprisingly, male shirking is equally high for weeding, which is considered
 a typical female task.
 We again reject random measurement error as driving disagreement, as well
 as the the hypothesis that disagreement is only due to cognitive bias (p-value
 =

, we proceed with a series of regressions to test if disagreement is due
 to strategically hiding labour contributions within the household, or whether
 disagreement reflects norms and expectations about who, according to society,
 should do what activity.
 The top panel reports on regressions where the outcome variable is the
 proportion of activities on which the female co-head reports to have worked
 less than what the male co-head thinks; the bottom panel reports on regressions
 where the dependent variable is the proportion of activities on which the
 male co-head report to have worked less than what the female co-head thinks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As is evident from results in the upper panel, neither the intervention
 facilitating mutual monitoring (T2) nor the intervention challenging role
 congruity by projecting a cooperative approach to farming by a male-female
 couple role model (T1) seems to have an effect on shirking behaviour by
 the female co-head.
 We find that shirking by the female co-head is lower for activities that
 are considered in the male domain.
 More surprisingly, we also find that shirking by the female co-head is
 lower for activities that are harder to monitor.
 We do not find any significant interaction effects between the intervention
 challenging role congruity and the indicator of male domain sensitivity,
 nor between the intervention facilitating mutual monitoring and the indicator
 of ease of monitoring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the bottom panel, we also do not find that our interventions affect shirking
 by the male co-head.
 We do find that shirking by the male co-head is lower for activities that

 We do not find that shirking is correlated to ease of monitoring of the
 activity.
 Neither do we find any significant interaction effects between the intervention
 challenging role congruity and the indicator of male domain sensitivity,
 nor between the intervention facilitating mutual monitoring and the indicator
 of ease of monitoring.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Household surveys that are serious about capturing gender-related heterogeneity
 often try to interview both male and female co-heads separately for at
 least part of the survey.
 This is an important means of reducing biases introduced by the (typically
 male) household head or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

most knowledgeable person
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the household, and represents an important advancement in the study
 of intrahousehold dynamics, especially in non-separable agricultural households
 where production and consumption decisions are so closely intertwined.
 A common finding in these surveys is that male and female co-heads often
 give substantially different answers to the same questions.
 While some discordance is inevitable due to random measurement error, recent
 studies have been searching for patterns in this disagreement, and suggest
 that systematic disagreement between spouses may be key in understanding
 intrahousehold power dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and reject that all disagreement between male and female co-heads of monogamous
 Ugandan maize farming households is due to random measurement error or
 cognitive bias due to spouses differently understanding or interpreting
 the questions.
 We then test if discord is mainly driven by co-heads hiding information
 from each other, or if it is due to co-heads responding in line with what
 society expects from them given prevailing gender norms and roles.
 This is done through a field experiment, with one video based intervention
 designed to facilitate mutual monitoring by co-heads and another video
 based intervention that encourages spouses to view maize farming as a cooperati
ve household enterprise by both male and female co-head rather than in the
 domain of the male co-head (as society tends to).
 We further explore impact pathways by looking at conditional average treatment
 effects, as we expect that the interventions would be most effective for
 decisions, activities and assets that are easier to hide or more susceptible
 to gender norms and customs assigning these to the male domain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found that co-heads generally agree with each other.
 Disagreement could not be explained by random measurement error alone,
 and cognitive bias is also not the main cause.
 We found that disagreement about the role of the female co-head in decision
 making about maize farming was reduced after co-heads were exposed to an
 intervention designed to reduce the influence of role congruity and gender
 norms and customs.
 We also found that disagreement about the role of both male and female
 co-heads in decision making about maize farming reduced in response to
 an intervention designed to facilitate mutual monitoring.
 Contrary to expectations, we did not find that the intervention designed
 to reduce the influence of role congruity, gender norms and customs was
 more effective for decisions that are considered to be more in the male
 domain.
 When looking at labour shirking behaviour on the part of female co-heads
 and male co-heads respectively, we did not find that the intervention designed
 to increase mutual monitoring had an impact, nor that more hideable activities
 would be impacted more.
 We also did not find that the intervention challenging role congruity,
 gender norms and customs made a difference,or more so for activities defined
 as typical male tasks according to gender norms and roles.
