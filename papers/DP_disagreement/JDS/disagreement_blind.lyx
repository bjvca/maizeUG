\begin_layout Title
Hiding, Shirking or Pleasing: Spousal Disagreement among Ugandan Maize Farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To gain a better understanding of intrahousehold bargaining processes, surveys
 increasingly collect data from co-heads individually, especially on decision
 making, asset ownership and labour contributions.
 However, answers provided by spouses on the same set of questions often
 differ substantially.
 Recent research suggests that, while some of this disagreement is due to
 random measurement error and cognitive bias, spouses also seem to hide
 information from each other.
 In this paper, we document differences in answers between male and female
 co-heads in smallholder maize farming households in eastern Uganda.
 We first confirm that not all disagreement can be explained by measurement
 error or bias.
 Using a field experiment, we then test if disagreement is due to spouses
 strategically hiding decisions and actions from each other.
 We also test an alternative explanation where discord is attributed to
 spouses' tendency to respond in line with prevailing norms and customs
 in society.
 While the interventions did seem to reduce discord in survey response about
 about decision making, we do not find that decision hiding nor reporting
 in line with gender norms and customs are the primary drivers.

\begin_layout Standard
Increased attention to the internal dynamics of agricultural households
 by both researchers and practitioners has led to various innovations in
 data collection

.
 Examples of best practice in data collection on intrahousehold decision-making
 processes include separate interviewing of male and female co-heads of
 the household using distinct survey instruments that may nonetheless contain
 common topics and questions.
 Studies using these instruments often find that spouses provide different
 answers on even the most basic questions

 demonstrate that, while part of these divergent responses may be attributable
 to measurement error, there is also a systematic component that reflects
 asymmetric information within households where one co-head does not have
 accurate knowledge about the decisions made, actions taken, or assets owned
 by the other.
 Furthermore, they argue that the fact that disagreement is larger for assets
 and decisions that are easier to hide suggests this is due to spouses strategic
ally hiding information.
 A number of lab-in-the-field experiments similarly confirm that, in many
 cases, household members conceal some of their resources from one another

In this paper, we investigate spousal disagreement in survey response among
 monogamous smallholder maize farmers in eastern Uganda.
 Drawing on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we explore the same three types of explanation for discordâ€”random measurement
 error, bias caused by men and women interpreting questions differently,
 and asymmetric information where men and women have only partly overlapping
 information sets.
 However, we go one step further and, using a field experiment, formally
 test if this asymmetric information between husband and wives should be
 attributed to spouses strategically hiding information from each other.
 This is done by randomly assigning a sample of households to a video based
 intervention designed to facilitate mutual monitoring and comparing disagreemen
t to a control group.
 Furthermore, we test for an alternative explanation, where the discord
 is not the result of asymmetric information, but rather of spouses answering
 in line with prevailing gender norms in society.
 Inspired by recent research on the use of role models to change attitudes
 and behviour in traditionally male dominated sectors, we test the impact
 of an intervention that promotes a mental image of maize farming as a cooperati
ve or joint venture in which both spouses play an equal role in maize farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider disagreement on the role of both female and male co-heads in
 decision making and labour provision.
 For disagreement about the wife's role in decision making, the focus is
 on hiding, defined as the likelihood that the wife reports she was involved
 in decision making but the husband says she was not.
 For disagreement about the husband's role, we consider the likelihood that
 the husband reports he was involved in the decision but the wife says he
 was not.
 For labour provision, we focus on shirking, defined as instances where
 the female co-head reports to have worked less than what the male co-head
 thinks.
 We also analyze shirking by the male co-head.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that measurement error alone can not explain disagreement in survey
 response.
 We also reject that differences in how male and female co-heads interpret
 the questions is the main driver for observed disagreement.
 For decision making, we find that disagreement related to the role of the
 female co-head can be partly explained by spouses responding in line with
 what is expected by society.
 However, there is also some evidence that spouses hide decisions for each
 other.
 We do not find that disagreement related to labour provision is due to
 spouses reporting in line with what society expects, nor that spouses shirk.

\begin_layout Section
Literature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our review of prior work on spousal disagreement focuses mainly on the empirical
 literature on intrahousehold resource allocation and decision-making in
 agricultural households in developing countries, and draws primarily on
 analyses that use observational data from surveys in which both spouses
 are interviewed separately and are asked the same set of questions.
 Such studies often focus on research questions related to women's empowerment
 and autonomy.
 For example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1728-4465.2002.00299.x"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 asks both spouses questions on the locus of decision-making on a variety
 of issues, as well as specific questions concerning women's mobility and
 access to resources.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 collect data from both spouses on a range of autonomy items, including
 the need of the wife to obtain the husband's permission to go to different
 types of places, the wife's capacity to decide on their children's affairs,
 whether the wife is allowed to have a job, and her role in deciding on
 the number of children and household expenditure-related decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common finding in studies that ask the same set of questions to different
 individuals within the household is that substantial disagreement often
 arises between spouses, even on questions that would seem easily and objectivel
y verifiable, such as the number of children, or type of material used for
 house construction.
 This divergence may simply be attributable to measurement error by the
 respondents.
 But 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggest that such divergence may also partly be due to the fact that the
 response categories do not have the same cognitive or semantic meanings
 to women and men, leading to the somewhat pessimistic conclusion that survey
 questions are of limited use in understanding differences in gender stratificat
ion across multiple contexts.

, in an investigation of variation in husband and wife perspectives on the
 division of authority over agriculture-related decisions in rural Tanzania,
 goes one step further by concluding that in the absence of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

intrahousehold accords,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it may be problematic for interventions informed by the analysis of survey
 data to reduce gender inequalities or empower women in agricultural households.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 note that spouses often give inconsistent answers when asked about who
 made a particular decision.
 They then test whether female unilateral decision-making is equally empowering
 if the male co-head disagrees that the woman took the decision alone, as
 compared to when the male co-head agrees.
 They conclude that disagreement may signal underlying power dynamics within
 the household that are likely to be relevant when assessing individual-level
 agency and empowerment.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANNAN2021105292"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 similarly look at underlying power dynamics by differentiating between
 instances where women are taking power and instances where women are given
 power.
 They find that taking power is positively correlated with a range of outcomes
 for women and children, but also argue that more research is needed to
 establish causality and identify which interventions induce women to claim
 power.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 provide a particularly insightful conceptual framework that teases out
 the various perspectives on spousal disagreement.
 First, they note that if disagreement solely derives from measurement error,
 disagreement should be symmetric, and the female co-head's responses should
 not differ systematically from the male co-head's responses.
 Second, they point out that if disagreement results from asymmetric measurement
 error in which men and women interpret questions differently (as suggested
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANDERSON2017169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), then answers should differ systematically between spouses, but disagreement
 should be similar for different questions asked in a survey.
 Finally, they argue that finding differing rates of disagreement across
 survey questions, and higher rates of disagreement for assets and activities
 that are easier to hide in particular, points to the presence of intrahousehold
 information asymmetries.
 Using observational data collected in Bangladesh, they find evidence that
 such information asymmetries in the form of hidden assets and decisions
 are present in their sampled households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Differential disagreement on different decisions, asset categories or activities
 need not reflect the act of one spouse intentionally deceiving another.
 There may be other systematic biases that manifest more in one activity,
 asset or decision category than others, and that may be shaped by prevailing
 gender roles and norms.
 For example, in a case study in northern Uganda, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that men often report unilateral decision-making in areas where they
 are assumed to bear final responsibility, even if women had some degree
 of involvement.
 Women tend to view these scenarios as joint decisions.
 As such, it is important to understand the local cultural context to differenti
ate spousal disagreement as a function of information asymmetries stemming
 from intentional hiding versus other gender-related systematic biases.

\begin_layout Section
Experimental design and interventions
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to random error and cognitive bias due to spouses in interpreting
 questions differently, the previous section shows that the emerging literature
 on spousal disagreement in survey response suggests two potential mechanisms.
 First, spousal disagreement may be due to cultural context in which these
 questions are asked and answered, with spouses responding in line with
 what would be expected in society 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A first treatment therefore attempts to challenge preconceived ideas of
 what decision-making of a spouse involves and who is expected to make decisions
 in a farm household by promoting a cooperative approach to maize farming,
 in which maize cultivation and management activities are seen as a joint
 responsibility of both spouses.
 Second, the literature also suggests that spousal disagreement reflects
 information asymmetries between spouses, predominantly cause by spouses
 hiding decisions, actions and assets from each other 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A second intervention tests if these asymmetries can be influenced by providing
 spouses equal access to information about best practices in maize farming
 prior to the point in time when decisions are made on cultivation and managemen
t, as this would facilitate mutual monitoring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the heart of both interventions is a short video that is shown twice
 to individuals within households using tablet computers.
 The aim of the video is to increase viewers' knowledge of recommended practices
 in maize farming, such as timely planting, row planting, and the use of
 improved inputs such hybrid seed and inorganic fertilizer.
 It does this through an aspirational story in which a farmer (or farmers)
 recounts how he/she/they used to be poor but managed to increase yields
 over time by applying a set of techniques and inputs.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The techniques and inputs that are demonstrated in the videos are the ones
 recommended by the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) and
 are also used by the public agricultural advisory system.
 More details can be found in [placeholder for reference removed for double
 blind review].
\end_layout

\end_inset

 It also suggests that farmers view maize farming as a business that needs
 continuous investment over time and includes some simple intertemporal
 cost-benefit calculations to illustrate this, followed by encouragements
 to follow the example of the model farmer(s) featured in the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first intervention, referred to as T1 in the remainder of the paper,
 involves varying the actors featured in the video and randomizing which
 version of the video is viewed by farmers.
 The second intervention, which we will refer to as T2, randomly varies
 the member(s) of the household who view the video.
 These variations and the rationale behind them are explained below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin with a conceptual explanation that ties to our first intervention
 (T1): projecting a cooperative way of farming as a household, thereby challengi
ng consensus that maize farming is a male activity.
 Consider that within households, individual members often have differing
 spheres of influence reflecting prevailing gender roles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lundberg1993separate"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In many agricultural households, women tend to have a stronger voice in
 the cultivation of crops that are predominately cultivated for home consumption
, while men have a stronger voice in the cultivation of crops that are marketed.
 Gendered differences in crop choices may emerge from a variety of factors,
 including gender-related differences in knowledge about the crop, access
 to planting material, access to inputs and extension services, and customs
 and traditions

.
 While the existence of such gendered patterns are widely acknowledged,
 they are not always easily captured in household survey data, as gender
 is only one of the determinants of crop portfolio choice

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Uganda, maize, which is in a part a cash crop, is considered to be mostly
 in the influence sphere of men.
 Generally, men make all important decisions such as what plots to plant
 maize on, how to prepare the land, when to start planting, and what seeds
 to use.
 Men also generally decide on how much labor is needed, while women assist
 men, often with weeding.
 While these are broad and stylized characterizations of Uganda's maize
 production system, their widespread acceptance as conventional wisdom makes
 maize farming a topic ripe for this study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specifically, we expect that such a separation in spheres of influence between
 male and female co-heads may contribute to spousal disagreement in survey
 response.
 Therefore, our first intervention randomly varies which version of our
 video is screened to our study participants.
 One version features a male-female couple who present themselves as role
 models to promote a worldview where both spouses participate equally in
 maize farming, while another version features only a male actor.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A third version of the video features only a female actor, but is not used
 in this study.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This approach capitalizes on recent evidence on the influence that role
 models can have on aspirations, investment choices, and other future-oriented
 behaviors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and on increasing women's participation in otherwise male-dominated sectors
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

; and the influence of engaging media content to expose large numbers of
 people to role models

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test the hypothesis that spouses disagree less if they view farming as
 a joint spousal activity, we randomly assign 261 households from our sample
 to be shown the cooperative image version of the video, such that both
 the male and female co-heads watch the video together.
 This group functions as the treatment group.
 We also randomly assign 240 households from our sample to be shown the
 version of the video featuring only a male actor, again with both the male
 and female co-heads watching together.
 Because the only difference between the two videos is the composition of
 the actors featured (a male-female couple versus a male actor), any difference
 in outcomes between the two groups should be attributed to the role model
 effect of the cooperative image intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we turn to our second hypothesis that relates to asymmetric information
 within the household.
 Consider the farm household as a collection of individuals, each with their
 own preferences, skills, assets, and access to resources.
 In many contexts, the household's existence and the welfare of its members
 depend on their collective capacity to invest in common goods by drawing
 on each individual's skills, assets, and resources.
 As such, households can be considered as informal institutions, and many
 of the problems encountered in common pool resource management and collective
 action, such as free-riding and overextraction of resources, apply to the
 household 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doss2015collective"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way in which collective action problems can be attenuated is through
 increased monitoring.
 For instance, if one co-head can assess the actual time that the other
 co-head spends on land preparation, then the latter is less likely to engage
 in labor shirking.
 However, for mutual monitoring to work, co-heads require information against
 which to compare information gained through monitoring, since merely observing
 an outcome may be insufficient to determine if a co-head is shirking, hiding,
 or otherwise mismanaging his or her collective obligations to the household.
 For instance, it may be difficult for the female co-head to check if her
 spouse overreports time spent preparing the field if she does not have
 a good understanding of what land preparation entails.
 If both spouses have a good understanding of what agricultural management
 entails, they are also in a better position to monitor each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a second treatment (T2), we therefore make sure both co-heads start off
 with symmetric information with respect to recommended agronomic practices
 for maize farming, as this is assumed to facilitate mutual monitoring.
 To do so, we show the video that showcases recommended practices in maize
 farming to both spouses in a random sample of 261 households.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We show the version of the video that features a couple (male and female
 actor-farmers), that is, the video used in the treatment group of the previous
 intervention.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This group acts as the treatment group.
 In another random sample of 540 households, the control group, the same
 video is shown, but only to one of the two co-heads.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We made sure that in about half of the cases the video was shown to the
 male co-head alone and in the other half of cases to the female co-head
 alone.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 As the only difference between the two groups is related to whom the video
 is shown to (couple versus individual), any difference in outcomes between
 the two groups should be attributed to reducing information asymmetry between
 spouses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Hypotheses and tests
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Hypotheses-and-tests"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we outline the different hypothesis and how they will be
 tested.
 While the focus will be on testing the impact of the interventions on spousal
 disagreement, we also use our data to test for random error and cognitive
 bias (due to spouses in interpreting questions differently) using the framework
 outline in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first hypothesis we will test is that disagreement between husband and
 wife is simply due to random noise.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 show that if random measurement error is the only factor leading to disagreemen
t, then disagreement should be symmetric.
 For instance, one would expect that the likelihood that the wife says she
 was involved in a particular decision while the husband says she was not
 is about the same as the likelihood that the husband says the wife was
 involved in that decision, while the wife says she was not.
 Or, one would expect that the likelihood that the husband says he worked
 harder on a particular task than what the wife believes is about the same
 as the likelihood that the husband indicates he spent less time on that
 task than what the wife thinks.
 Testing if disagreement between husband and wife is simply due to random
 measurement error is thus equivalent to testing if two proportions are
 significantly different from each other, which we will do using a Pearson

 noise alone,

 They define asymmetric measurement error as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

...measurement error that occurs systematically and leads to different patterns
 of responses for men and women (p.
 770)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 They go on to explain that this could be due to differences in understanding
 or interpretation of the questions, or differences in perceptions of what
 it means to make a decision, what constitutes agricultural labour, or what
 it entails to own an asset.
 This type of disagreement is categorized as measurement error because it
 does not adequately reflect what happens in reality

Testing for asymmetric measurement error is done by checking if the probability
 of disagreement about a spouse's role in decision making, labour provision,
 or marketing, is equal across the various decisions and activities under
 consideration.

We will refer to decision making here to keep the exposition simple, but
 in the analysis we also consider disagreement between spouses on labour
 contributions.

 We then test the joint null hypothesis that disagreement levels are equal
 across decisions, which amounts to constraining the intercepts 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\alpha_{d}\right)$

 to be equal to each other.
 If we reject the null, this means that disagreement about decision making
 between spouses cannot be fully explained by symmetric measurement error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note the implicit assumption that this type of error
 has its origin at the level of the individuals within the household (eg
 the wife has lower education leading her to systematically underestimate
 effort), and so should not lead to heterogeneity within the household.
 Therefore, instead of referring to this as asymmetric measurement error,
 we see this more as bias caused by factors that emanate from the individual
 level.
 Generally, this individual level variation will be due to differing cognitive
 capacities of spouses and difference in how questions are interpreted by
 husband and wife 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Obviously, this will also be affected by cultural factors,

 they refer to as asymmetric information within the household.

Although Ambler et al argue that this behaviour could be strategic or unintentio
nal (the husband may simply not be cognizant of the full range of decisions
 that she makes or assets that she have).
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 While they admit that some of this disagreement may be unintentional, they
 also note that the fact that disagreement seems to be highest among assets
 that are more easily hidden (small livestock, poultry, and small durables)
 suggests that at least part of this hiding is strategic
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I am not sure I am convinced here.
 I think this relationship is conflated by the number of assets held.
 For instance, it is more likely that both spouses agree they have only
 one chicken that that they agree that when they have 54 chickens, keeping
 hiding constant.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Following this line of reasoning, we define
\emph on
 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{d}$
\end_inset


\emph default
, a measure of how easy it is to hide decision making related to 
\emph on
d
\emph default
, and explore correlations between disagreement and this measure.
 We further provide an explicit test for this hypothesis by comparing average
 disagreement between spouses in households that were exposed to a treatment
 designed to facilitate mutual monitoring to average disagreement between
 spouses (T2) in households that did not receive this intervention.
 This is done using the following OLS regression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{i,d}=\alpha+\beta.T_{i}+\varepsilon_{i,d}\label{eq:ATE}
\end{equation}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}$
\end_inset

 denotes the treatment status of household 
\emph on
i
\emph default
, which is a dummy that takes the value of one for households that received
 the intervention and zero for the control group.
 We expect that providing both spouses with information that facilitates
 mutual monitoring will lead to a reduction in disagreement, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, if disagreement is due to strategically hiding, we expect that
 facilitating monitoring would be most effective for decisions that are
 easier to hide.
 We thus also estimate conditional average treatment effects by interaction
 the treatment indicator with the measure of how easy it is to hide decision
 or activity

\end_inset

 consider this form of disagreement part of symmetric measurement error.
 We argue that disagreement that arises from spouses responding in line
 with expectations in society may differ between decision categories.
 For instance, disagreement between spouses on to the role of women in weeding
 may be very different from disagreement related to the role of women in
 land preparation.
 In the former case, as weeing is seen as a typical female activity, men
 may have no problems admitting that the woman did all the work.
 For the latter case, as society expects men to do the often heavy work
 of preparing the fields, men may be more reluctant to disclose that their
 wife also spent considerable time on this task.
 This is in line with what

 find in in northern Uganda, where men often report unilateral decision-making
 in areas where they are assumed to bear final responsibility, but women
 indicate that they were involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We thus test if part of the disagreement that 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 attribute to asymmetric information may actually be the result of spouses

 Now, the treatment status of household

\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}$

, is a dummy that takes the value of one if spouses were exposed to a couple
 role model video intervention (T1), and zero if a video was shown where
 only a man featured in the video.
 If cultural norms indeed drive disagreement, we expect the treatment to
 reduce disagreement

 For this hypothesis, we also define

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study was conducted among monogamous maize-farming households in five
 districts in eastern Uganda, an area known for its maize production.
 Households that participated in the study were recruited using a two-stage
 cluster sampling approach to obtain a representative sample of this population.
 Specifically, we first selected 50 parishes randomly and in proportion
 to the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all households, and in each village
 we sampled 10 households to be included in the study.
 This resulted in a total sample size of 3,280 households.
 However, in about 23 percent of the households we were unable to interview
 both spouses separately, resulting in an effective sample of 2,548 households.
 The interventions described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 were implemented in random subsets of this sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We focused on the second maize-growing season of 2017, which ran from about
 August 2017, when fields were prepared, to January 2018, when maize was
 harvested.
 Treatments were administered twice, once in August 2017 when farmers were
 preparing fields, and one month later during planting time.
 Concurrent with the first treatment administration in 2017, we also collected
 information on household characteristics and on the previous harvest, which
 was the first harvesting season of 2017.
 End-line data was collected after the harvest in February 2018.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmers in our study area cultivated on average about 1.5 plots of maize.
 Yields during the first season of 2017 were extremely low (about 270 kilograms
 per acre) as a result of a Fall Armyworm outbreak that significantly affected
 the maize crop.
 Baseline data indicated that the average household in our sample consisted
 of 8 individuals.
 Female co-heads in these households were on average 35 years old and only
 30 percent have finished primary education.
 Male co-heads are on average 43 years old and 42 percent have finished
 primary education.
 Only 11 percent of households reported that they had access to agricultural
 extension in the year prior to the survey.
 Only 17 percent of households used fertilizer on at least one plot, and
 38 percent reported using improved seed bought from a shop or agro-input
 dealer during the last cropping season (April-July 2017).
 About three quarters of households reported owning a mobile phone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first area in which we explore disagreement between husband and wife is
 in decision-making related to maize farming.
 In our survey, we asked the head of household to list all maize plots that
 the household was cultivating during the season preceding the survey (that
 is, the second agricultural season of 2017).
 We then cycled through the different plots and asked a series of questions
 for each plot, and repeated the same questions separately with the other
 co-head.
 For a range of key decisions that need to be made and that are known to
 significantly affect maize yields, we asked who made the decision on that
 particular plot.
 Respondents could answer that decisions were made by (1) the respondent
 him- or herself alone, (2) the respondent's spouse alone, (3) the respondent
 jointly with his or her spouse, (4) someone else inside or outside the
 respondent's household, (5) the respondent together with someone else inside
 or outside the household, or (6) the respondent's spouse together with
 someone else inside or outside the household.
 Respondents could also indicate that they did not know who made the decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first decision we consider is simply who decided that maize should be
 planted on the particular plot.
 A second decision is related to timing of planting, recognizing that planting
 date is a strong agronomic determinant of yields.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
NARO recommends that maize planting start immediately after the first rains
 of the season.
 This often results in significant time pressure on household members' labor
 time, especially when large areas need to be planted.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The third decision relates to the spacing of seed and the seeding rate,
 which reflects the fact that row planting at a rate of one seed per mound
 is also a strong determinant of yield.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is a wide range of seed methods used by farmers in Uganda.
 While some simply broadcast seeds, NARO recommends row planting because
 it results in significantly higher yields since it reduces competition
 between plants for sunlight and soil nutrients.
 Farmers also often plant more than one seed per hill because they fear
 some seeds may not germinate.
 However, planting more than one seed per hill also tends to increase competitio
n for light and nutrients, leading to stunted plant growth.
 It is therefore recommended to use only one seed per hill and engage in
 gap filling when seeds do not germinate after one week.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We also consider decisions related to weed control.
 For weeding, we differentiate between decision-making related to strategies
 used to combat striga infestation (a parasitic weed that feeds off the
 roots of the maize plant) and weeding more generally.
 Finally, we look at decision making related to maize marketing, and ask
 who sold took the decision to sell (part of the) maize that was harvested.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also collected detailed information on labor time.
 On each maize plot, we asked each co-head how much time, expressed in labor
 days over the entire agricultural season, he or she worked on a particular
 activity.
 We also asked each co-head to give an estimate of how much time his or
 her spouse worked on the plot on that particular task.
 The activities we inquired about are land preparation, planting, weeding,
 spraying, and harvesting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the outcome variables and the treatment indicators, there
 are two additional important variables in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:CATE"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 First, to test if strategic hiding is the main cause for disagreement,
 we also construct an indicator of how easy it is to monitor particular
 decisions, activities or actions.
 To do so, we asked 30 experts to score each activity (eg.
 time spend to weeding) in terms of ease of monitoring on a scale between
 0 and 100, with 0 being impossible to find out actions of the spouse and
 100 being very easy to find out.
 We only scored labour contributions, as we thought decision making is very
 hard to monitor anyway.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, to test if gender norms and customs are driving spousal disagreement,
 we also created a indicator for the extent to which a particular action
 or decision is culturally believed to be more in the male domain.
 This was done by asking the same 30 experts to indicate who, within the
 household, is typically (i.e.
 by prevailing norms and customs) expected to make the particular decision
 (eg.
 the decision on what seed spacing and seed rate to use) or perform a particular
 action (eg.
 weeding).
 This was again scored on a scale running from 0 (typically the wife alone)
 to 100 (typically the husband alone).

To investigate disagreement between answers reported by husbands and wives
 about who within the household made various decisions related to maize
 cultivation, we construct various indicators based on answers of both spouses.
 To assess (dis)agreement about the role of the wife in decision making,
 we define three different categories: (1) both spouses agree on the woman's
 role in decision making
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This includes cases where neither spouse says that the wife was involved
 in decision making as well as cases where both spouses say that the wife
 was involved in decision making (either alone or as part of the couple).

; (2) the wife says that she was involved (either alone or jointly with
 the husband), but the husband says she was not; and (3) the husband says
 the wife was involved (either alone or as part of the couple), but the
 wife says she was not.

 In particular, they refer to this as instances where the women

, whereas category 3 is considered to be situations where the woman is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Similarly, to assess (dis)agreement about the role of the the husband,
 the three categories are: (1) spouses agree on the husband's role in decision
 making; (2) the husband says that he was involved (either alone or jointly
 with the wife), but the wife says he was not; and (3) the wife says the
 husband was involved (either alone or as part of the couple), but the husband
 says he was not.
 Categories (2) and (3) can be pooled to obtain an indicator for disagreement
 on the involvement in decision making of the spouse.

 The top panel shows that spouses mostly agree on the wife's role in decision
 making.
 Focusing on disagreement, we see that on the average plot the likelihood
 that the female co-head says she was involved in a particular decision
 but the husband disagrees (category 2) is always higher than the likelihood
 that the husband says his wife was involved but the wife disagrees (category
 3) except for the decision to sell maize.

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom panel shows that spouses agree even more about the role of the

 Looking into disagreement, the likelihood that the husband claims he was

 the likelihood that the wife says the husband was involved but the husband
 says he was not.

The second column in the table shows that disagreement also reduces in response
 to the treatment that tries to facilitate monitoring (T2): In the control

 This suggests that spouses may also hide decision making from each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third column regresses the indicator that captures sensitivity of the
 particular decision to gender norms on disagreement about the wife's role
 in decision making.
 We do not find that the indicator is correlated with disagreement.

 and includes both the treatment that challenges role incongruity, the indicator
 for susceptibility to gender norms, and an interaction between the two.
 We see that the treatment still leads to reduction in disagreement.
 However, contrary to expectations, we do also not find that the intervention
 reduced disagreement differently for decisions that are assumed to be in
 the male domain than for decisions that are less gendered.
 This goes against our hypothesis that the change in disagreement in response
 to the treatment is mediated by gender norms and customs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom panel repeats the analysis, but the dependent variable is now
 an indicator for instances where the husband says he decided but the wife
 says he was not involved in the decision.
 As we saw earlier, disagreement about the husband's role is lower; the
 first column confirms that in the control group where households were not
 exposed to the intervention that attempts to challenge gender norms (T1),
 in

 percent of decisions men claim a larger role than women admit.
 This percentage is not significantly different in the treatment group,
 which suggests that the role of men in agricultural decision making is
 less socially contested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second column, we do see that the intervention aimed at facilitating
 mutual monitoring (T2) reduced disagreement.
 In the control group where only one of the spouses was shown a video on
 what maize farming entails, male co-heads report they were involved but
 the wife disagreed in

 percentage points.
 This suggests that also male co-heads may hide decision making from the
 wife.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third column in the table shows that we find significant correlation
 between spousal disagreement related to the role of the male co-head and
 the indicator that attempts to measure how sensitive an activity is in
 terms of gender norms.
 Apparently, the likelihood that the male co-head reports he was involved
 while the wife claims he was not is significantly higher for decisions
 that were judged to be more in the male domain (the decision to sell, decision
 to plant maize, and decision to fight striga) than for decisions that were
 seen less a responsibility for the man (decision on when to weed).
 However, the fourth column again rejects the hypothesis that this disagreement
 is driven by gender norms and customs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Labour Provision
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For labour contributions, we define the three categories of (dis)agreement
 as follows: A first category (1) consists of cases where there is agreement
 on the wife's labour contribution.
 For disagreement, we differentiate between cases where (2) the wife reported
 to have spend more time on a particular task than the husband thinks she
 spent on it and (3) the wife reported spending less time than the husband
 thinks.
 Labour contribution (and hence disagreement about it) is also measured
 at the plot level.
 As for decision making, we consider disagreement related to the labour
 provided by the wife and disagreement related to labour provided by the
 husband separately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above, we consider labour to be a bad, with spouses preferring
 to work less rather than more.
 The category of interest here is therefore category (3), where spouses
 are shirking on their responsibilities, putting in less hours than what
 the other spouse thinks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One complication here is that labour time is measured as a continuous variable:
 days spent on the activity.
 As a result, the margin of error will also depend on the activity.
 For example, for an activity such as spraying of insecticides, fungicides
 or herbicides, women report that they spend on average only 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{desc[1]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 days.
 Women report that they spend considerably more time on weeding (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{desc[2]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 days).
 These differences in magnitude will also have consequences for the likelihood
 that spouses agree.
 For instance, in the former case, there is agreement about the wife's labour
 time contribution on 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{desc[3]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of plots, while for weeding, this is only the case on 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{desc[4]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of plots.
 We try to mitigate this problem by defining agreement in relation to the
 underlying variable, indicating that there is agreement if estimates are
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close enough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to each other.
 In particular, if labour time difference is within one standard deviation
 of the average time reported by wife and husband, we consider there is
 agreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The top panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 shows that spouses again generally agree about the labour contribution
 of the wife

But this is dependent on the definition of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

.
 Agreement seems to be highest for the wife's role in spraying.
 This is not surprising because spraying insecticides, fungicides and herbicides
 involves carrying a heavy knapsack sprayer and handling of dangerous substances
, and is generally considered to be the responsibility of the man in the
 household.
 As such, in most cases spouses agree that the wife had no role in this
 activity.
 This is also reflected in scores of the experts, who overwhelmingly state
 this is a typical male task (87/100).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The table further shows that agreement is lowest for women's labour provision
 in weeding, which the experts claim is predominantly a female task.
 Interestingly, we find a relatively high share of plots where the wife
 says she worked more than what the husband thinks.
 But there are also signs of shirking behaviour.
 For example, on 15 percent of the plots, there are indications that the
 wife shirks on her weeding activities.

-squared tests comparing rows 2 and 3 shows that we reject equality of the
 two disagreement categories for all labour types, suggesting that disagreement
 on women labour time is not caused by random measurement error alone.
 We also find that we reject the null hypothesis that disagreement about
 the wife's labour contribution is equal across different labour categories,
 judged by a Wald test after estimating equation

 (p-value =

).
 This again means that discord cannot be explained by cognitive differences
 between spouses alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom panel shows results of disagreement about the husband's labour
 contribution.
 Agreement seems to be similar to agreement about the wife's labour contribution.
 Shirking by the husband is high for labour provided for spraying, a typical
 male activity that is also difficult to monitor.
 Surprisingly, male shirking is equally high for weeding, which is considered
 a typical female task.
 We again reject symmetric measurement error as driving disagreement, as
 well as the the hypothesis that disagreement is only due to cognitive bias
 (p-value = 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Standard
In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:labour_regressions"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we proceed with a series of regressions to test if disagreement is due
 to strategically hiding labour contributions within the household, or whether
 disagreement reflects who, according to society, should do what activity.
 The top panel reports on regressions where the outcome variable is the
 proportion of activities on which the wife reports to have worked less
 than what the husband thinks; the bottom panel reports on regressions where
 the dependent variable is the proportion of activities on which the husband
 report to have worked less than what the wife thinks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neither treatment seems to have an effect on shirking behaviour.
 We find that shirking by the wife is lower for activities that are considered
 in the husband's domain.
 More surprisingly, we also find that shirking is lower for activities that
 are harder to monitor.
 We do not find any significant interaction effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the bottom panel, we also do not find that our treatments affect shirking
 by the husband.
 We do find that shirking is lower for activities that are in the male domain.
 We do not find that shirking is correlated to ease of monitoring and also
 do not find any interaction effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Household surveys that are serious about capturing gender-related heterogeneity
 often try to interview both male and female co-heads separately for at
 least part of the survey.
 This is an important means of reducing biases introduced by the (typically
 male) household head or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

most knowledgeable person
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the household, and represents an important advancement in the study
 of intrahousehold dynamics, especially in non-separable agricultural households
 where production and consumption decisions are so closely intertwined.
 A common finding in these surveys is that male and female co-heads often
 give substantially different answers to the same questions.
 While some discordance is inevitable due to measurement error, recent studies
 have been searching for patterns in this disagreement, and suggest that
 systematic disagreement between spouses may be key in understanding intrahouseh
old power dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and reject that all disagreement between male and female co-heads of Ugandan
 maize farming households is due to random measurement error or bias due
 to spouses differently understanding or interpreting the questions.
 We then test if discord is mainly driven by spouses hiding information
 from each other, or if it is due to spouses responding in line with what
 society expects from them.
 This is done through a field experiment, with a video based intervention
 designed to facilitate mutual monitoring of spouses and an intervention
 that encourages spouses to view maize farming as a household enterprise
 rather than in the domain of the male co-head (as society does).
 We further explore impact pathways by looking at conditional average treatment
 effects, as we expect that the treatments would be most effective for decisions
, activities and assets that are easier to hide or more susceptible to gender
 norms and customs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found that spouses generally agreed with each other.
 Disagreement could not be explained by measurement error alone, and cognitive
 bias is also not the main cause.
 We found that disagreement about the role of the wife in decision making
 was reduced after spouses were exposed to an intervention designed to reduce
 the influence of gender norms and customs.
 We also found that disagreement about the role of both male and female
 co-heads reduced in response to an intervention designed to facilitate
 mutual monitoring.
 Contrary to expectations, we did not find that the intervention designed
 to reduce the influence of gender norms and customs was more effective
 for decisions that are considered to be more in the male domain, which
 goes against our hypothesis that the change in disagreement in response
 to the treatment is mediated by gender norms and customs.
 When looking at shirking behaviour, we did not find that the treatment
 designed to increase mutual monitoring had an impact.
 We also did not find that the treatment that projects a cooperative approach
 to maize farming made a difference.
