\begin_layout Title
Hiding, Shirking or Pleasing: Spousal Disagreement among Ugandan Maize Farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To gain a better understanding of intrahousehold bargaining processes, surveys
 increasingly collect data from co-heads individually, especially on decision
 making, asset ownership and labour contributions.
 However, answers provided by co-heads on the same set of questions often
 differ substantially.
 Recent research suggests that, while some of this disagreement is due to
 random measurement error and cognitive bias, co-heads also seem to hide
 information from each other.
 In this paper, we document differences in answers between male and female
 co-heads in monogamous smallholder maize farming households in eastern
 Uganda.
 We first confirm that not all disagreement can be explained by measurement
 error or bias.
 Using a field experiment, we then test if disagreement is due to co-heads
 strategically hiding decisions and actions from each other.
 We also test an alternative explanation where discord is attributed to
 co-heads' tendency to respond in line with prevailing gender norms and
 customs in society.
 While the interventions did seem to reduce discord in survey response about
 about decision making, we do not find that decision hiding nor reporting
 in line with gender norms and customs are the primary drivers.

 Examples of best practice in data collection on intrahousehold decision-making
 processes include separate interviewing of male and female co-heads of
 (dual-headed) households using distinct survey instruments that may nonetheless
 contain common topics and questions.
 Studies using these instruments often find that co-heads provide different
 answers on even the most basic questions

 demonstrate that, while part of these divergent responses may be attributable
 to measurement error, there is also a systematic component that reflects
 asymmetric information within households where one co-head does not have
 accurate knowledge about the decisions made, actions taken, or assets owned
 by the other.
 Furthermore, they argue that the fact that disagreement is larger for assets
 and decisions that are easier to hide suggests this is due to spouses strategic
ally hiding information.
 A number of lab-in-the-field experiments similarly confirm that, in many
 cases, household members conceal some of their resources from one another

In this paper, we investigate spousal disagreement in survey response among
 monogamous smallholder maize farming households in eastern Uganda.
 Drawing on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we explore the same three types of explanation for discordâ€”random measurement
 error, bias caused by men and women interpreting questions differently,
 and asymmetric information where men and women have only partly overlapping
 information sets.
 However, we go one step further and, using a field experiment, formally
 test if this asymmetric information between husband and wives should be
 attributed to spouses strategically hiding information from each other.
 This is done by randomly assigning a sample of households to a video based
 intervention designed to facilitate mutual monitoring and comparing spousal
 disagreement to a control group.
 Furthermore, we test for an alternative explanation, where the discord
 is not the result of asymmetric information, but rather of spouses answering
 in line with prevailing gender norms in society.
 Inspired by recent research on the use of role models to change attitudes
 and behaviour in traditionally male dominated sectors, we test the impact
 of a video based intervention that promotes a mental image of maize farming
 as a cooperative or joint venture in which both spouses play an equal role
 in maize farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider spousal disagreement on the role of both female and male co-heads
 in decision making and labour provision.
 For disagreement about the female co-head's role in decision making, the
 focus is on hiding, defined as the likelihood that the female co-head reports
 she was involved in decision making but the male co-head says she was not.
 For disagreement about the male co-head's role, we consider the likelihood
 that the male co-head reports he was involved in the decision but the female
 co-head says he was not.
 For labour provision, we focus on shirking, defined as instances where
 the female co-head reports to have worked less than what the male co-head
 thinks.
 We also analyze shirking by the male co-head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that measurement error alone can not explain observed spousal disagreeme
nt in survey responses.
 We also reject that differences in how male and female co-heads interpret
 the questions is the main driver for observed disagreement.
 For decision making, we find that disagreement related to the role of the
 female co-head can be partly explained by co-heads responding in line with
 what is expected by society.
 However, there is also some evidence that co-heads hide decisions for each
 other.
 We do not find that disagreement related to labour provision is due to
 co-heads reporting in line with what society expects, nor that co-heads
 shirk.

\begin_layout Section
Literature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our review of prior work on spousal disagreement focuses mainly on the empirical
 literature on intrahousehold resource allocation and decision-making in
 (dual-headed) agricultural households in low and middle income countries,
 and draws primarily on analyses that use observational data from surveys
 in which both male and female co-heads are interviewed separately and are
 asked the same set of questions.
 Such studies often focus on research questions related to women's empowerment
 and autonomy.
 For example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1728-4465.2002.00299.x"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 asks both co-heads questions on the locus of decision-making on a variety
 of issues, as well as specific questions concerning women's mobility and
 access to resources.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"

\end_inset

 collect data from both co-heads on a range of autonomy items, including
 the need of the female co-head to obtain the male co-head's permission
 to go to different types of places, the female co-head's capacity to decide
 on their children's affairs, whether the female co-head is allowed to have
 a job, and her role in deciding on the number of children and household
 expenditure-related decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common finding in studies that ask the same set of questions to different
 individuals within the household is that substantial disagreement often
 arises between co-heads, even on questions that would seem easily and objective
ly verifiable, such as the number of children, or type of material used
 for house construction.
 This divergence may simply be attributable to measurement error by the
 respondents.
 But 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggest that such divergence may also partly be due to the fact that the
 response categories do not have the same cognitive or semantic meanings
 to women and men, leading to the somewhat pessimistic conclusion that survey
 questions are of limited use in understanding differences in gender stratificat
ion across multiple contexts.

, in an investigation of variation in husband and wife perspectives on the
 division of authority over agriculture-related decisions in rural Tanzania,
 goes one step further by concluding that in the absence of

 it may be problematic for interventions informed by the analysis of survey
 data to reduce gender inequalities or empower women in agricultural households.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 note that co-heads often give inconsistent answers when asked about who
 made a particular decision.
 They then test whether female unilateral decision-making is equally empowering
 if the male co-head disagrees that the woman took the decision alone, as
 compared to when the male co-head agrees.
 They conclude that disagreement may signal underlying power dynamics within
 the household that are likely to be relevant when assessing individual-level
 agency and empowerment.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANNAN2021105292"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 similarly look at underlying power dynamics by differentiating between
 instances where women are taking power and instances where women are given
 power.
 They find that taking power is positively correlated with a range of outcomes
 for women and children, but also argue that more research is needed to
 establish causality and identify which interventions induce women to claim
 power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"

\end_inset

 provide a particularly insightful conceptual framework that teases out
 the various perspectives on spousal disagreement.
 First, they note that if disagreement solely derives from measurement error,
 disagreement should be symmetric, and the female co-head's responses should
 not differ systematically from the male co-head's responses.
 Second, they point out that if disagreement results from asymmetric measurement
 error in which men and women interpret questions differently (as suggested
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANDERSON2017169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), then answers should differ systematically between co-heads, but disagreement
 should be similar for different questions asked in a survey.
 Finally, they argue that finding differing rates of disagreement across
 survey questions, and higher rates of disagreement for assets and activities
 that are easier to hide in particular, points to the presence of intrahousehold
 information asymmetries.
 Using observational data collected in Bangladesh, they find evidence that
 such information asymmetries in the form of hidden assets and decisions
 are present in their sampled households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Differential disagreement on different decisions, asset categories or activities
 need not reflect the act of one co-head intentionally deceiving another.
 There may be other systematic biases that manifest more in one activity,
 asset or decision category than others, and that may be shaped by prevailing
 gender roles and norms.
 For example, in a case study in northern Uganda, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that men often report unilateral decision-making in areas where they
 are assumed to bear final responsibility, even if women had some degree
 of involvement.
 Women rather report these scenarios as joint decisions

 Hence, it is important to understand the local cultural context to differentiat

 from intentional hiding versus other gender-related systematic biases.

Experimental design and interventions
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to random error and cognitive bias due to spouses in interpreting
 questions differently, the previous section shows that the emerging literature
 on spousal disagreement in survey response suggests two potential mechanisms.
 First, spousal disagreement may be due to cultural context in which these
 questions are asked and answered, with co-heads responding in line with
 what would be expected in society 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A first intervention in our field experiment therefore attempts to challenge
 preconceived ideas of what decision making by a male or female co-head
 involves and who is expected to make decisions in a farm household by promoting
 a cooperative approach to maize farming, in which maize cultivation and
 management activities are seen as a joint responsibility of both co-heads.
 Second, the literature also suggests that spousal disagreement reflects
 information asymmetries between co-heads, predominantly cause by co-heads
 hiding decisions, actions and assets from each other 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A second intervention tests if these asymmetries can be influenced by providing
 co-heads equal access to information about best practices in maize farming
 prior to the point in time when decisions are made on cultivation and managemen
t, as this would facilitate mutual monitoring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the heart of both interventions is a short video that is shown twice
 to individual co-heads within households using tablet computers.
 The aim of the video is to increase viewers' knowledge of recommended practices
 in maize farming, such as timely planting, row planting, and the use of
 improved inputs such hybrid seed and inorganic fertilizer.
 It does this through an aspirational story in which a farmer (or farmers)
 recounts how he/she/they used to be poor but managed to increase yields
 over time by applying a set of techniques and inputs.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The techniques and inputs that are demonstrated in the videos are the ones
 recommended by the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) and
 are also used by the public agricultural advisory system.
 More details can be found in [placeholder for reference removed for double
 blind review].
\end_layout

\end_inset

 It also suggests that farmers view maize farming as a business that needs
 continuous investment over time and includes some simple intertemporal
 cost-benefit calculations to illustrate this, followed by encouragements
 to follow the example of the model farmer(s) featured in the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first intervention, referred to as T1 in the remainder of the paper,
 involves varying the gender composition of the actors featured in the video
 and randomizing which version of the video is viewed by farmers.
 The second intervention, which we will refer to as T2, randomly varies
 the gender composition of the co-head(s) of the household who view the
 video.
 These variations and the rationale behind them are explained below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin with a conceptual explanation that ties to our first intervention
 (T1): projecting a cooperative way of farming as a household, thereby challengi
ng the local consensus that maize farming is a male activity.
 Consider that within households, individual members often have differing
 spheres of influence reflecting prevailing gender roles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In many agricultural households, including in Uganda, women tend to have
 a stronger voice in the cultivation of crops that are predominately cultivated
 for home consumption, while men have a stronger voice in the cultivation
 of crops that are marketed

 Gendered differences in crop choices, as well as gendered ownership and
 management of crops, may emerge from a variety of factors, including gender-rel
ated differences in knowledge about the crop, access to planting material,
 access to inputs and extension services, access to land and quality of
 land, and customs and traditions

 While the existence of such gendered patterns are widely acknowledged,
 they are not always easily captured in household survey data, as gender
 is only one of the determinants of crop portfolio choice

In Uganda, maize, which is in a part a cash crop, is considered to be mostly

 Generally, men make all strategic decisions such as what plots to plant
 maize on, how to prepare the land, when to start planting, and what seeds
 to use.
 Men also generally decide on how much labor is needed, while women assist
 men.
 Labor division in maize farming, in many cases, is organised according
 to gender roles, with men taking up tasks such as land clearing and marketing,
 and women weeding and post-harvest processing.
 While these are broad and stylized characterizations of Uganda's maize
 production system, their widespread acceptance as conventional wisdom makes
 maize farming a topic ripe for this study.

careful: in my view, the fact that maize is both a cash crop and a food
 crop makes (that) some women also grow maize on plots they manage; and
 there are maize plots under joint management.
 in my view, the fact that maize is not entirely an exclusive men domain
 (entirely separate sphere of influence) opens the scope to strenghten women's
 involvement in decision making about maize.

\begin_layout Standard
Specifically, we expect that such a separation in spheres of influence between
 male and female co-heads and gendered labor division may contribute to
 spousal disagreement in survey response.
 Therefore, our first intervention randomly varies which version of our
 video is screened to our study participants.
 One version features a couple of male and female actor-farmers who present
 themselves as role models to promote a worldview where both male and female
 co-heads participate equally in maize farming, while another version features
 only a male actor-farmer.

 behaviors

\begin_layout Standard
To test the hypothesis that male and female co-heads disagree less if they
 view farming as a joint spousal activity, we randomly assign 261 households
 from our sample to be shown the cooperative image version of the video
 where co-heads participate equally in maize farming, such that both the
 male and female co-heads in the household watch the video together.
 This group functions as the treatment group.
 We also randomly assign 240 households from our sample to be shown the
 version of the video featuring only a male actor-farmer, again with both
 the male and female co-heads watching together.
 Because the only difference between the two videos is the gender composition
 of the actors featured (a couple of male and female actor-farmers versus
 a male actor), any difference in outcomes between the two groups should
 be attributed to the role model effect of the cooperative image intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we turn to our second hypothesis that relates to asymmetric information
 within the household.
 Consider the farm household as a collection of individuals, each with their
 own preferences, skills, assets, and access to resources.
 In many contexts, the household's existence and the welfare of its members
 depend on their collective capacity to invest in common goods by drawing
 on each individual's skills, assets, and resources.
 As such, households can be considered as informal institutions, and many
 of the problems encountered in common pool resource management and collective
 action, such as free-riding and overextraction of resources, apply to the
 household 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way in which collective action problems can be attenuated is through
 increased mutual monitoring 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "AGRAWAL20011649"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, if one co-head can assess the actual time that the other
 co-head spends on land preparation, then the latter is less likely to engage
 in labor shirking.
 However, for mutual monitoring to work, co-heads require information against
 which to compare information gained through monitoring, since merely observing
 an outcome may be insufficient to determine if a co-head is shirking, hiding,
 or otherwise mismanaging his or her collective obligations to the household.
 For instance, it may be difficult for the female co-head to check if her
 spouse overreports time spent preparing the field if she does not have
 a good understanding of what land preparation entails.
 If both co-heads have a good understanding of what agricultural management
 entails, they are also in a better position to monitor each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a second treatment (T2), we therefore make sure both co-heads start off
 with symmetric information with respect to recommended agronomic practices
 for maize farming, as this is assumed to facilitate mutual monitoring.
 To do so, we show the video that showcases recommended practices in maize
 farming to both male and female co-heads together in a random sample of
 261 households.

We show the version of the video that features a couple (male and female

 This group acts as the treatment group.
 In another random sample of 540 households, the control group, the same
 video is shown, but only to one of the two co-heads.

We made sure that in about half of the cases the video was shown to the

 As the only difference between the two groups is related to whom the video
 is shown to (couple of male and female co-heads versus individual co-head),
 any difference in outcomes between the two groups should be attributed
 to reducing information asymmetry between co-heads.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we outline the different hypothesis and how they will be
 tested.
 While the focus will be on testing the impact of the interventions on spousal
 disagreement, we also use our data to test for random error and cognitive
 bias (due to spouses in interpreting questions differently) using the framework
 outline in

A first hypothesis we will test is that disagreement between husband and
 wife is simply due to random noise.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

literal "false"

\end_inset

 show that if random measurement error is the only factor leading to disagreemen
t, then disagreement should be symmetric.
 In such case, one would expect, for instance, that the likelihood that
 the female co-head says she was involved in a particular decision while
 the male co-head says she was not is about the same as the likelihood that
 the male co-head says the female co-head was involved in that decision,
 while the female co-head says she was not.
 Or, one would expect that the likelihood that the male co-head says he
 worked harder on a particular task than what the female co-head believes
 is about the same as the likelihood that the male co-head indicates he
 spent less time on that task than what the female co-head thinks.
 Testing if disagreement between male and female co-head is simply due to
 random measurement error is thus equivalent to testing if two proportions
 are significantly different from each other, which we will do using a Pearson

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 (p.

 They go on to explain that this could be due to differences in understanding
 or interpretation of the questions, or differences in perceptions of what
 it means to make a decision, what constitutes agricultural labour, or what
 it entails to own an asset.
 This type of disagreement is categorized as measurement error because it
 does not adequately reflect what happens in reality

Testing for asymmetric measurement error is done by checking if the probability

 approach, where we use a Wald test for joint significance (using a cluster

 In particular, we start from the following equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{i,d}=\alpha_{d}+\varepsilon_{i,d}\label{eq:f_test}
\end{equation}

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We will refer to decision making here to keep the exposition simple, but
 in the analysis we also consider disagreement between spouses on labour
 contributions.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We then test the joint null hypothesis that disagreement levels are equal
 across decisions, which amounts to constraining the intercepts 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\alpha_{d}\right)$
\end_inset

 to be equal to each other.
 If we reject the null, this means that disagreement about decision making
 between spouses cannot be fully explained by asymmetric measurement error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note the implicit assumption that this type of error
 has its origin at the level of the individuals within the household (e.g.
 the female co-head has lower education leading her to systematically underestim
ate effort), and so should not lead to heterogeneity within the household.
 Therefore, instead of referring to this as asymmetric measurement error,
 we see this more as bias caused by factors that emanate from the individual
 level.
 Generally, this individual level variation will be due to differing cognitive
 capacities of co-heads and difference in how questions are interpreted
 by male and female co-head 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Obviously, this can also be affected by cultural factors,

 I think this relationship is conflated by the number of assets held.

 We argue that disagreement that arises from spouses responding in line
 with expectations 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637142104
in society
\change_unchanged
 may differ between decision categories.
 For instance, disagreement between

spouses
\change_inserted -408277422 1637142120
co-heads

 on 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637142123
to
\change_unchanged
 the role of women in weeding may be very different from disagreement related
 to the role of women in land preparation.
 In the former case, as wee
\change_inserted -408277422 1637142145
d
\change_unchanged
ing is seen as a typical female activity, men may have no problems admitting
 that 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637142186
the woman
\change_inserted -408277422 1637142190
their female co-head
\change_unchanged
 did all the work.
 For the latter case, as society expects men to do the often heavy work
 of preparing the fields, men may be more reluctant to disclose that their
 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637142197
wife
\change_inserted -408277422 1637142197
 female co-head
\change_unchanged
 also spent considerable time on this task.
 This is in line with what

 in our study area cultivated on average about 1.5 plots of maize.
 Yields during the first season of 2017 were extremely low (about 270 kilograms
 per acre) as a result of a Fall Armyworm outbreak that significantly affected
 the maize crop.
 Baseline data indicated that the average household in our sample consisted
 of 8 individuals.
 Female co-heads in these households were on average 35 years old and 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637142803
only

 30 percent have finished primary education.
 Male co-heads are on average 43 years old and 42 percent have finished

 survey.
 Only 17 percent of households used fertilizer on at least one plot, and
 38 percent reported using improved seed bought from a shop or agro-input
 dealer during the last cropping season (April-July 2017).
 About three quarters of households reported owning a mobile phone.

A first area in which we explore disagreement between 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637142971

\change_deleted -408277422 1637142977

making related to maize farming.
 In our 
\change_inserted -408277422 1637143077
endline 
\change_unchanged
survey, we asked the 
\change_inserted -408277422 1637142962
male co-
\change_unchanged
head of household to list all maize plots that the household was cultivating
 during the season preceding the 
\change_inserted -408277422 1637143088
endline 
\change_unchanged
survey (that is, the second agricultural season of 2017).
 We then cycled through the different plots and asked a series of questions
 for each plot, and repeated the same questions separately with the 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637143096
other
\change_inserted -408277422 1637143099
female
\change_unchanged
 co-head.
 For a range of key decisions that need to be made and that are known to
 significantly affect maize yields, we asked who made the decision on that
 particular plot.
 Respondents could answer that decisions were made by (1) the respondent
 him- or herself alone, (2) the respondent's spouse alone, (3) the respondent
 jointly with his or her spouse, (4) someone else inside or outside the
 respondent's household, (5) the respondent together with someone else inside
 or outside the household, or (6) the respondent's spouse together with
 someone else inside or outside the household.
 Respondents could also indicate that they did not know who made the decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first decision we consider is simply who decided that maize should be
 planted on the particular plot.
 A second decision is related to timing of planting, recognizing that planting
 date is a strong agronomic determinant of yields.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
NARO recommends that maize planting start immediately after the first rains
 of the season.
 This often results in significant time pressure on household members' labor
 time, especially when large areas need to be planted.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The third decision relates to the spacing of seed and the seeding rate,
 which reflects the fact that row planting at a rate of one seed per mound
 is also a strong determinant of yield.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is a wide range of seed methods used by farmers in Uganda.
 While some simply broadcast seeds, NARO recommends row planting because
 it results in significantly higher yields since it reduces competition
 between plants for sunlight and soil nutrients.
 Farmers also often plant more than one seed per hill because they fear
 some seeds may not germinate.
 However, planting more than one seed per hill also tends to increase competitio
n for light and nutrients, leading to stunted plant growth.
 It is therefore recommended to use only one seed per hill and engage in
 gap filling when seeds do not germinate after one week.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We also consider decisions related to weed control.
 For weeding, we differentiate between decision

\change_deleted -408277422 1637143167
-
\change_unchanged
making related to strategies used to combat striga infestation (a parasitic
 weed that feeds off the roots of the maize plant) and weeding more generally.
 Finally, we look at decision making related to maize marketing, and ask
 who sold took the decision to sell (part of the) maize that was harvested.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also collected detailed information on labor time.
 On each maize plot, we asked each co-head 
\change_inserted -408277422 1637143217
separately 
\change_unchanged
how much time, expressed in labor days over the entire agricultural season,
 he or she worked on a particular activity.
 We also asked each co-head to give an estimate of how much time 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637143250
his or her spouse
\change_inserted -408277422 1637143253
the other co-head
\change_unchanged
 worked on the plot on that particular task.
 The activities we inquired about are land preparation, planting, weeding,
 spraying, and harvesting.

 First, to test if strategic hiding is the main cause for disagreement,
 we also construct an indicator

\change_unchanged
of how easy it is 
\change_inserted -408277422 1637143342
for co-heads of households 
\change_unchanged
to monitor particular decisions, activities or actions.
 To do so, we asked 30

\change_unchanged

 hard to monitor anyway.

Second, to test if gender norms and customs are driving spousal disagreement,
 we also created a

n
\change_unchanged
 indicator 
\change_inserted -408277422 1637149660
(H1) 
\change_unchanged
for the extent to which a particular action or decision is culturally believed
 to be more in the male domain.
 This was done by asking the same 30 experts to indicate who, within the
 household, is typically (i.e.
 by prevailing norms and customs) expected to make the particular decision
 (e
\change_inserted -408277422 1637143383

 weeding).
 This was again scored on a scale running from

\change_inserted -408277422 1637149777
 The indicator H1 takes the value one for an activity or decision if the
 average expert score is larger than 55 situating it in the male domain;
 and zero otherwise.

wife
\change_inserted -408277422 1637150424

\change_unchanged
's labour contribution.
 For disagreement, we differentiate between cases where (2) the 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637150432

\change_inserted -408277422 1637150515
male co-head
\change_unchanged
 thinks.
 Labour contribution (and hence disagreement about it) is also measured
 at the plot level.
 As for decision making, we consider disagreement related to the labour
 provided by the 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637150515

\change_inserted -408277422 1637150445

 These differences in magnitude will also have consequences for the likelihood
 that 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637150548
spouses
\change_inserted -408277422 1637150550

 For instance, in the former case, there is agreement about the 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637150482

 We try to mitigate this problem by defining agreement in relation to the

 In particular, if labour time difference is within one standard deviation
 of the average time reported by

wife
\change_inserted -408277422 1637150596
female co-head
\change_unchanged
's role in spraying.
 This is not surprising because spraying insecticides, fungicides and herbicides
 involves carrying a heavy knapsack sprayer and handling of dangerous substances
, and is generally considered to be the responsibility of the 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637150605
man
\change_inserted -408277422 1637150607
male co-head
\change_unchanged
 in the household.
 As such, in most cases 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637150612
spouses 
\change_inserted -408277422 1637150614
co-heads

agree that the

wife
\change_inserted -408277422 1637150617
female co-head
\change_unchanged
 had no role in this activity.
 This is also reflected in scores of the experts, who overwhelmingly state
 this is a typical male task (87/100).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The table further shows that agreement is lowest for 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637150685
women
\change_inserted -408277422 1637150685
female co-head
\change_unchanged
's labour provision in weeding, which the experts claim is predominantly
 a female task.
 Interestingly, we find a relatively high share of plots where the 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637150697
wife
\change_inserted -408277422 1637150697

 thinks.
 But there are also signs of shirking behaviour.
 For example, on 15 percent of the plots, there are indications that the

\change_inserted -408277422 1637150707

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Household surveys that are serious about capturing gender-related heterogeneity
 often try to interview both male and female co-heads separately for at
 least part of the survey.
 This is an important means of reducing biases introduced by the (typically
 male) household head or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

most knowledgeable person
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the household, and represents an important advancement in the study
 of intrahousehold dynamics, especially in non-separable agricultural households
 where production and consumption decisions are so closely intertwined.
 A common finding in these surveys is that male and female co-heads often
 give substantially different answers to the same questions.
 While some discordance is inevitable due to 
\change_inserted -408277422 1637159733
random 
\change_unchanged
measurement error, recent studies have been searching for patterns in this
 disagreement, and suggest that systematic disagreement between spouses
 may be key in understanding intrahousehold power dynamics.

In this study, we follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and reject that all disagreement between male and female co-heads of 
\change_inserted -408277422 1637159756
monogamous 
\change_unchanged
Ugandan maize farming households is due to random measurement error or 
\change_inserted -408277422 1637159765
cognitive 
\change_unchanged
bias due to spouses differently understanding or interpreting the questions.
 We then test if discord is mainly driven by 
\change_deleted -408277422 1637159795
spouses
\change_inserted -408277422 1637159797
