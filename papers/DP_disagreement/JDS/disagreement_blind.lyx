\begin_layout Title
Bragging and Hiding: Spousal Disagreement among Ugandan Maize Farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To gain a better understanding of intrahousehold bargaining processes, surveys
 increasingly collect data from co-heads individually, especially on decision
 making, asset ownership and labour contributions.
 However, answers provided by spouses on the same set of questions often
 differ substantially.
 Recent research suggests that, while some of this disagreement is due to
 measurement error, part of it reflects real information asymmetry, where
 one spouse knows more than the other.
 The fact that disagreement also seems higher for assets that are easier
 to hide suggests spouses may strategically hide information from each other.
 In this paper, we test this hypothesis by checking if facilitating mutual
 monitoring reduces disagreement.
 Furthermore, we explore an alternative explanation, whereby differences
 in responses are driven by role congruity, where spouses provide answers
 that are in line with gendered norms and customs in society.

Increased attention to the internal dynamics of agricultural households
 by both researchers and practitioners has led to various innovations in
 data collection

.
 Examples of best practice in data collection on intrahousehold decision-making
 processes include separate interviewing of male and female co-heads of
 the household using distinct survey instruments that may nonetheless contain
 common topics and questions.
 Studies using these instruments often find that spouses provide different
 answers on even the most basic questions

 demonstrate that while part of these divergent responses may be attributable
 to measurement error, there is also a systematic component that reflects
 asymmetric information within households where one co-head does not have
 accurate knowledge about the decisions made, actions taken, or assets owned
 by the other.
 Furthermore, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 find suggestive evidence that spousal disagreement in reporting is larger
 for assets that can be hidden more easily than other types of assets, suggestin
g that spouses exploit these information asymmetries by deliberately hiding
 information, assets, and decisions from each other.
 A number of lab-in-the-field experiments similarly confirm that, in many
 cases, household members conceal some of their resources from one another

 in the context of monogamous smallholder maize farmers in eastern Uganda.
 In particular, we test for the same three types of explanation for discordâ€”rand
om measurement error, asymmetric measurement error, and asymmetric information.
 However, we also go one step further and, using a field experiment, formally
 test if this asymmetric information between husband and wives should be
 attributed to spouses strategically hiding information from each other.
 Furthermore, we test for an alternative explanation, where the discord
 is not the result of asymmetric information, but rather of spouses answering
 in line with prevailing gender norms in society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are mainly concerned with disagreement on the role of women in maize
 farming.
 We thus asked women about their involvement in a range of important maize
 farming related decisions, how much they worked on different maize farming
 related activities, and what their role was in marketing of maize after
 the harvest.
 We also interviewed the husband separately and asked him about his wife's
 involvement in decision making, labour and marketing.
 Answers of the two co-heads were than compared to measure disagreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we find that measurement error alone can not explain all disagreement,
 and explore alternative reasons for this disagreement about the role of
 the wife in agriculture.
 First, we test if disagreement should be attributed to strategically hiding
 actions, assets or activities through an intervention that is expected
 make it easier for spouses to monitor each other.
 Second, we wonder if disagreement is due to spouses responding in line
 with what is expected given their gender role in society.
 Inspired by recent research on behavioral change communication and social
 marketing, we try to manipulate these norms and test a treatment that promotes
 a mental image of maize farming as a cooperative or joint venture in which
 both spouses play an equal role in decision-making, farming activities,
 and rewards.

\begin_layout Section
Literature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our review of prior work on spousal disagreement focuses mainly on the empirical
 literature on intrahousehold resource allocation and decision-making in
 agricultural households in developing countries, and draws primarily on
 analyses that use observational data from surveys in which both spouses
 are interviewed separately and are asked the same set of questions.
 Such studies often focus on research questions related to women's empowerment
 and autonomy.
 For example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1728-4465.2002.00299.x"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 asks both spouses questions on the locus of decision-making on a variety
 of issues, as well as specific questions concerning women's mobility and
 access to resources.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 collect data from both spouses on a range of autonomy items, including
 the need of the wife to obtain the husband's permission to go to different
 types of places, the wife's capacity to decide on their children's affairs,
 whether the wife is allowed to have a job, and her role in deciding on
 the number of children and household expenditure-related decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common finding in studies that ask the same set of questions to different
 individuals within the household is that substantial disagreement often
 arises between spouses, even on questions that would seem easily and objectivel
y verifiable, such as the number of children, or type of material used for
 house construction.
 This divergence may simply be attributable to measurement error by the
 respondents.
 But 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggest that such divergence may also partly be due the fact that the response
 categories do not have the same cognitive or semantic meanings to women
 and men, leading to the somewhat pessimistic conclusion that survey questions
 are of limited use in understanding differences in gender stratification
 across multiple contexts.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

, in an investigation of variation in husband and wife perspectives on the
 division of authority over agriculture-related decisions in rural Tanzania,
 goes one step further by concluding that in the absence of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it may be problematic for interventions informed by the analysis of survey
 data to reduce gender inequalities or empower women in agricultural households.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "SEYMOUR201897"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 note that spouses often give inconsistent answers when asked about who
 made a particular decision.
 They then test whether female unilateral decision-making is equally empowering
 if the male co-head disagrees that the woman took the decision alone, as
 compared to when the male co-head agrees.
 They conclude that disagreement may signal underlying power dynamics within
 the household that are likely to be relevant when assessing individual-level
 agency and empowerment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 provide a particularly insightful conceptual framework that teases out
 the various perspectives on spousal disagreement.
 First, they note that if disagreement solely derives from measurement error,
 disagreement should be symmetric, and the female co-head's responses should
 not differ systematically from the male co-head's responses.
 Second, they point out that if disagreement results from asymmetric measurement
 error in which men and women interpret questions differently, then answers
 should differ systematically between spouses, but disagreement should be
 similar for different questions asked in a survey.
 Finally, they argue that finding differing rates of disagreement across
 survey questions, and higher rates of disagreement for assets and activities
 that are easier to hide in particular, points to the presence of intrahousehold
 information asymmetries.
 Using observational data collected in Bangladesh, they find evidence that
 such information asymmetries in the form of hidden assets and decisions
 are present in their sampled households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This should not be interpreted to mean that information asymmetries always
 reflect the act of one spouse intentionally deceiving another.
 There may be other systematic biases that manifest more in one asset or
 decision category than others, and that may be shaped by prevailing gender
 roles and norms.
 For example, in a case study in northern Uganda, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that men often report unilateral decision-making in areas where they
 are assumed to bear final responsibility, even if women had some degree
 of involvement.
 Women tend to view these scenarios as joint decisions.
 As such, it is important to understand the local cultural context to differenti
ate spousal disagreement as a function of information asymmetries stemming
 from intentional hiding versus other gender-related systematic biases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANNAN2021105292"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 offer another illustration of the conceptual and analytical value of intrahouse
hold contention over decision-making.
 They argue that assessing agency and empowerment requires that disagreement
 be considered not by its presence or absence, but also in terms of its
 direction.
 Specifically, they differentiate cases in which male co-heads disagree
 with their spouse claiming to be involved in decision-making from cases
 where male co-heads disagree with their spouse claiming not to be involved
 in decision-making.
 The former is interpreted as women 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

taking power
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, while the latter is interpreted as women 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being given power
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While most studies focus on disagreement with respect to decision-making,
 divergent responses on income streams and asset ownership are also commonly
 observed in household data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "for example, "
key "twyman2015gendered"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 As such, instead of simply recording whether an asset is owned by a spouse
 using a yes/no question, some studies go further and try to place values
 on incomes and assets.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "castilla2012ties"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 uses the male co-head's own reporting of his own farm income and compares
 this to the female co-headâ€™s reporting of her husband's farm income to
 identify income hiding by men, and finds that female co-heads' estimate
 of farm income is on average 14 percent lower than what male co-heads report.
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "FISHER2010966"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that in 66 percent of the Malawian households they studied, the male
 co-head understated his wifeâ€™s income by an average of 47 percent of what
 the female co-head reported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While most of the studies noted above explore patterns in spousal disagreement,
 other studies extend the line of inquiry to examine correlations with welfare
 outcomes of households, women, and children 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ANNAN2021105292,doi:10.1086/703082,SEYMOUR201897"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 The emerging consensus is that spousal disagreement is closely correlated
 with â€“ and likely causally linked to â€“ a wide range of welfare outcomes.
 Following from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ANNAN2021105292"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we attempt to fill a gap in the literature that attempts to better understand
 these causal pathways and to explore interventions that might change intrahouse
hold dynamics via a reduction in spousal disagreement.

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The emerging literature on spousal disagreement in survey response suggests
 at least two underlying mechanisms.
 First, spousal disagreement may reflect different cognitive understanding
 of the responses categories in a survey questionnaire and what the appropriate
 response should be 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "GHUMAN20061"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This problem is compounded by the cultural context in which these questions
 are asked and answered 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"

\end_inset

.
 A first treatment therefore attempts to challenge preconceived ideas of
 what decision-making of a spouse involves and who is expected to make decisions
 in a farm household by promoting a cooperative approach to maize farming,
 in which maize cultivation and management activities are seen as a joint
 responsibility of spouses.
 Second, the literature also suggests that spousal disagreement reflects
 information asymmetries between spouses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A second intervention tests if these asymmetries can be influenced by providing
 spouses equal access to information about best practices in maize farming
 prior to the point in time when decisions are made on cultivation and managemen
t.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the heart of both interventions is a short video that is shown twice
 to individuals within households using tablet computers.
 The aim of the video is to increase viewers' knowledge of recommended practices
 in maize farming, such as timely planting, row planting, and the use of
 improved inputs such hybrid seed and inorganic fertilizer.
 It does this through an aspirational story in which a farmer (or farmers)
 recounts how he/she/they used to be poor but managed to increase yields
 over time by applying a set of techniques and inputs.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The techniques and inputs that are demonstrated in the videos are the ones
 recommended by the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) and
 are also used by the public agricultural advisory system.
 More details can be found in [placeholder for reference removed for double
 blind review].
\end_layout

\end_inset

 It also suggests that farmers view maize farming as a business that needs
 continuous investment over time and includes some simple intertemporal
 cost-benefit calculations to illustrate this, followed by encouragements
 to follow the example of the model farmer(s) featured in the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first intervention involves varying the actors featured in the video
 and randomizing which version of the video is viewed by farmers.
 The second intervention randomly varies the member(s) of the household
 who view the video.
 These variations and the rationale behind them are explained below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin with a conceptual explanation that ties to our first intervention:
 projecting a cooperative way of farming as a household.
 Consider that within households, individual members often have differing
 spheres of influence reflecting prevailing gender roles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lundberg1993separate"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In many agricultural households, though certainly not all, women tend to
 have a stronger voice in the cultivation of crops that are predominately
 cultivated for home consumption, while men have a stronger voice in the
 cultivation of crops that are marketed.
 Gendered differences in crop choices may emerge from a variety of factors,
 including gender-related differences in knowledge about the crop, access
 to planting material, access to inputs and extension services, and customs
 and traditions

key "NORDHAGEN2021105134,doi:10.1177/0030727019831704"

\end_inset

.
 While the existence of such gendered patterns are widely acknowledged,
 they are not always easily captured in household survey data, as gender
 is only one of the determinants of crop portfolio choice

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Uganda, maize, which is in a part a cash crop, is considered to be mostly
 in the influence sphere of men.
 Generally, men make all important decisions such as what plots to plant
 maize on, how to prepare the land, when to start planting, and what seeds
 to use.
 Men also generally decide on how much labor is needed, while women assist
 men, often with weeding.
 While these are broad and stylized characterizations of Uganda's maize
 production system, their widespread acceptance as conventional wisdom makes
 maize farming a topic ripe for this study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specifically, we expect that such a separation in spheres of influence between
 male and female co-heads may contribute to spousal disagreement in survey
 response.
 Therefore, our first intervention randomly varies which version of our
 video is screened to our study participants.
 One version features a male-female couple who present themselves as role
 models to promote a worldview where both spouses participate equally in
 maize farming, while another version features only a male actor.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A third version of the video features only a female actor, but is not used
 in this intervention.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This approach capitalizes on recent evidence on the influence that role
 models can have on aspirations, investment choices, and other future-oriented
 behaviors

 and on increasing women's participation in otherwise male-dominated sectors
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 people to role models

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test the hypothesis that spouses disagree less if they view farming as
 a joint spousal activity, we randomly assign 261 households from our sample
 to be shown the cooperative image version of the video, such that both
 the male and female co-heads watch the video together.
 This group functions as the treatment group.
 We also randomly assign 240 households from our sample to be shown the
 version of the video featuring only a male actor, again with both the male
 and female co-heads watching together.
 Because the only difference between the two videos is the composition of
 the actors featured (a male-female couple versus a male actor), any difference
 in outcomes between the two groups should be attributed to the role model
 effect of the cooperative image intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we turn to our second hypothesis that relates to asymmetric information
 within the household.
 Consider the farm household as a collection of individuals, each with their
 own preferences, skills, assets, and access to resources.
 In many contexts, the household's existence and the welfare of its members
 depend on their collective capacity to invest in common goods by drawing
 on each individual's skills, assets, and resources.
 As such, households can be considered as informal institutions, and many
 of the problems encountered in common pool resource management and collective
 action, such as free-riding and overextraction of resources, apply to the
 household 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doss2015collective"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way in which collective action problems can be attenuated is through
 increased mutual monitoring.
 For instance, if one co-head can assess the actual time that the other
 co-head spends on land preparation, then the latter is less likely to engage
 in labor shirking.
 Similarly, if a co-head can determine how much the other co-head earns
 from the sale of farm produce, then the latter is less likely to engage
 in income hiding.
 However, for mutual monitoring to work, co-heads require information against
 which to compare information gained through monitoring, since merely observing
 an outcome may be insufficient to determine if a co-head is shirking, hiding,
 or otherwise mismanaging his or her collective obligations to the household.
 Thus, information on exactly what operations land preparation entails or
 on the prevailing market price for farm produce is necessary for effective
 monitoring.
 For instance, it may be difficult for the female co-head to check if her
 spouse overreports time spent preparing the field if she does not have
 a good understanding of what land preparation entails.
 If both spouses have a good understanding of what agricultural management
 entails, they are also in a better position to monitor each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a second treatment, we therefore make sure both co-heads start off with
 symmetric information with respect to recommended agronomic practices for
 maize farming, as this facilitates mutual monitoring.
 To do so, we show the video that showcases recommended practices in maize
 farming to both spouses in a random sample of 261 households.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We show the version of the video that features a couple (male and female
 actor-farmers), that is, the video used in the treatment group of the previous
 intervention.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This group acts as the treatment group.
 In another random sample of 540 households, the control group, the same
 video is shown, but only to one of the two co-heads.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We made sure that in about half of the cases the video was shown to the
 male co-head alone and in the other half of cases to the female co-head
 alone.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 As the only difference between the two groups is related to whom the video
 is shown to, any difference in outcomes between the two groups should be
 attributed to reducing information asymmetry between spouses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Hypothesis and tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first hypothesis is that disagreement between husband and wife is simply
 due to random noise.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 show that if random measurement error is the only factor leading to disagreemen
t, then disagreement should be symmetric.
 For instance, one would expect that the likelihood that the wife says she
 was involved in a decision while the husband says she was not is about
 the same as the likelihood that the husband says the wife was involved
 in that decision, while the wife says she was not.
 Or, one would expect that the likelihood that the wife says she worked
 harder than what the husband estimates is about the same as the likelihood
 that the wife indicates she spent less time on a task then what the husband
 thinks.
 Testing this hypothesis is thus equivalent to testing if two proportions
 are significantly different from each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once it is established that disagreement can not be fully explained by random
 noise, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 test for asymmetric measurement error.
 They define asymmetric measurement error as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

...measurement error that occurs systematically and leads to different patterns
 of responses for men and women (p.
 770)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This could be due to differences in understanding or interpretation of
 the questions, or differences in perceptions of what it means to make a
 decision, what constitutes agricultural labour, or what it entails to own
 an asset.
 They also explicitly state that asymmetric measurement error could be caused
 by cultural factors that lead to men under-reporting women's roles.
 This type of disagreement is categorized as measurement error because it
 does not adequately reflect what happens in reality

Test for asymmetric measurement error is done by checking if the probability
 of disagreement about the wife's role in decision making is equal across
 the various activities on which decisions have to be made.

 approach where we use a Wald test for joint significance (using a cluster
 robust and a Approximate Hotelling 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{2}$
\end_inset

 Test).
 In particular, we start from the following equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{i,d}=\alpha_{d}+\varepsilon_{i,d}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $y_{i,d}$
\end_inset

 represents disagreement within household 
\emph on

 about a particular decision 
\emph on

.
 We then test the joint null hypothesis that disagreement levels are equal
 across decisions, which amounts to constraining the intercepts 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\alpha_{d}\right)$
\end_inset

 to be equal to each other.
 If we reject the null, this means that disagreement can not be fully explained
 by symmetric measurement error.

 argue that rejecting both types of measurement error indicates that disagreemen
t reflects a real difference in what spouses know from each other, a situation
 they refer to as asymmetric information within the household.

Although Ambler et al argue that this behaviour could be strategic or unintentio
nal (the husband may simply not be cognizant of the full range of decisions
 that she makes or assets that she have).
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 While they admit that some of this disagreement may be unintentional, they
 also note that the fact that disagreement seems to be highest among assets
 that are more easily hidden (small livestock, poultry, and small durables)
 suggests that at least part of this hiding is strategic
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I am not sure I am convinced here.
 I think this relationship is conflated by the number of assets held.
 For instance, it is more likely that both spouses agree they have only
 one chicken that that they agree that when they have 54 chickens, keeping
 hiding constant.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Following this line of reasoning, we define
\emph on
 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{d}$
\end_inset


\emph default
, a measure of how easy it is to hide decision making related to 
\emph on
d
\emph default
, and explore correlations between disagreement and this measure.
 We further provide an explicit test for this hypothesis by comparing average
 disagreement between spouses in households that were exposed to a treatment
 designed to facilitate mutual monitoring to average disagreement between
 spouses in households that did not receive this intervention.
 This is done in using the following OLS regression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{i,d}=\alpha+\beta.T_{i}+\varepsilon_{i,d}\label{eq:ATE}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}$
\end_inset

 denotes the treatment status of household 
\emph on
i
\emph default
, which is a dummy that takes the value of one if both spouses received
 information and zero if only one of the spouses received information.
 We expect that providing both spouses with information facilitates monitoring,
 which leads to a reduction in disagreement, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we expect that facilitating monitoring would be most effective
 for decisions that are easier to hide.
 We thus also estimate conditional average treatment effects by interaction
 the treatment indicator with the measure of how easy it is to hide decision
 making related to 
\emph on
d:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

 can then be taken as further evidence that disagreement is driven by spouses
 strategically hiding decisions for each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We mentioned earlier that disagreement may also result from spouses responding
 in line with expectations.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 consider this form of disagreement part of symmetric measurement error
 and argue that this cannot be the main driver of observed disagreement
 because disagreement differs between decision and asset categories.
 We argue that disagreement that arises from spouses responding in line
 with expectations in society may differ between decision categories.
 For instance, disagreement between spouses on to the role of women in weeding
 may be very different from disagreement relate to the role of women in
 land preparation.
 In the former case, as weeing is seen as a typical female activity, men
 may have no problems admitting that women did all the work.
 For the latter case, as society expects men to do the often heavy work
 of preparing the fields, men may be more reluctant to disclose that their
 wife also spent considerable time on this task.
 This is in line with what 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2019.1650169"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find in in northern Uganda, where men often report unilateral decision-making
 in areas where they are assumed to bear final responsibility, but women
 indicate that they were involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We thus provide an alternative explanation for differential disagreement
 between decision categories, and models similar to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 are estimated to test if disagreement is due to spouses' responding in
 line with cultural norms and expectations.
 Now, the treatment status of household 
\emph on
i
\emph default
, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}$
\end_inset

, is a dummy that takes the value of one if spouses were exposed to a couple
 role model, and zero if a video was shown where only a man featured in
 the video.
 If cultural norms indeed drive disagreement, we expect the treatment to
 reduce disagreement 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\beta<0\right)$
\end_inset

.
 For this hypothesis, we define
\emph on
 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{d}$
\end_inset


\emph default
 to indicate who within the household is deemed responsible for decision
 
\emph on
d

 according to prevailing norms and customs, and again explore correlations
 between disagreement and this measure.
 We also interact it

 effect on activities or decisions that are most affected by gender norms.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interventions described above were conducted among monogamous maize-farming
 households in five districts in eastern Uganda, an area known for its maize
 production.
 Our survey of households that participated in the study was deployed with
 a two-stage cluster sampling approach to obtain a representative sample
 of this population.
 Specifically, we first selected 50 parishes randomly and in proportion
 to the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all households, and in each village
 we sampled 10 households to be included in the study.
 This resulted in a total sample size of 3,280 households.
 However, in about 23 percent of the households we were unable to interview
 both spouses separately, resulting in an effective sample of 2,548 households.
 The interventions described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Experimental-design-and"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 were implemented in random subsets of this sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We focus on the second maize-growing season of 2017, which runs from about
 August 2017, when fields are prepared, to January 2018, when maize is harvested.
 Treatments were administered twice, once in August 2017 when farmers were
 preparing fields, and one month later during planting time.
 Concurrent with the first treatment administration in 2017, we also collected
 information on household characteristics and on the previous harvest, which
 was the first harvesting season of 2017.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmers in our study area cultivated on average about 1.5 plots of maize.
 Yields during the first season of 2017 were extremely low (about 270 kilograms
 per acre) as a result of a Fall Armyworm outbreak that significantly affected
 the maize crop.
 Baseline data indicate that the average household in our sample consisted
 of 8 individuals.
 Female co-head in these households are on average 35 years old and only
 30 percent have finished primary education.
 Male co-heads are on average 43 years old and 42 percent have finished
 primary education.
 Only 11 percent of households report that they had access to agricultural
 extension in the year prior to the survey.
 Only 17 percent of households used fertilizer on at least one plot, and
 38 percent reported using improved seed bought from a shop or agro-input
 dealer during the last cropping season (April-July 2017).
 About three quarters of households reported owning a mobile phone.

To investigate disagreement between answers reported by husbands and wives,
 we construct measures based on answers of both spouses.
 Given the large number of potential response combinations, it is useful
 to collapse responses into a few meaningful categories to reduce noise
 and facilitate analysis.
 We follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703082"

\end_inset

 who focus on whether the couple agrees on the wife's involvement.
 More in particular, we define three different categories: (1) spouses agree
 on the woman's role in decision making
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This includes cases where neither spouse says that the wife was involved
 in decision making as well as cases where both spouses say that the wife
 was involved in decision making (either alone or as part of the couple).
\end_layout

\end_inset

; (2) the wife says that she was involved (either alone or jointly with
 the husband), but the husband says she was not; and (3) the husband says
 the wife was involved (either alone or as part of the couple), but the
 wife says she was not.
 The last two categories can be collapsed into an indicator for disagreement
 on the involvement of the wife in decision making.
 These indicators are defined at the plot level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For labour contributions, we define three corresponding categories.
 A first category consists of cases where there is agreement on the wife's
 labour contribution.
 For disagreement, we differentiate between cases where (1) the wife reported
 to have spend more time than the husband reported and (2) the wife reported
 spending less time than the husband reported.
 Labour contribution (and hence disagreement about it) is also measured
 at the plot level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One complication here is that labour time is measured as a continuous variable:
 days spent on the activity.
 As a result, the margin of error will differ between activities.
 For example, for an activity such as spraying of insecticides, fungicides
 or herbicides, women report that they spend on average only 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{desc[1]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 days.
 Women report that they spend considerably more time on weeding (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{desc[2]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 days).
 These differences in magnitudes will also have consequences for the likelihood
 that spouses agree.
 For instance, in the former case, there is agreement on time reported in
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{desc[3]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households, while for weeding, this is only the case in 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{desc[4]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households.
 While this will not affect the tests for random measurement error, it may
 affect conclusions related to differences in disagreement rates between
 decision.
 We try to mitigate this problem by defining agreement in relation to the
 underlying variable.
 In particular, if labour time difference is within one standard deviation
 of the average time reported by wife and husband, we consider there is
 agreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For market participation, we construct an indicator for agreement related
 to selling or not.
 If both husband and wife report positive sales by the women (alone or as
 joint sale), we categorize this as agreement.
 If both report zero sales, this is also considered agreement.
 We differentiate again between two disagreement categories.
 In a first category women claim they sold maize (either alone or as part
 of the couple), while the husband claims she did not.
 In a second category it is the other way round, as the main claims the
 women sold maize, but the wife says she did not sell maize.
 We also construct indicators of agreement related to quantity sold and
 income derived from maize sold.
 As these are continuous variables, we again categorize disagreement if
 answers more than one standard deviation of the average of the underlying
 variables.
 Market participation is measured at the household level.

, shows agreement and disagreement about the wife's involvement in decision
 making.
 It shows that spouses mostly agree on the wife's role in decision making.
 Focusing on disagreement, we see that on the average plot the likelihood
 that the women says she was involved in decision making but the man disagrees
 (category 2) is always higher than the likelihood that the husband says
 his wife was involved but the wife disagrees (category 3).
 P-values indicate that in all but on case, we reject the null of symmetric
 measurement error.

We now proceed with a series of regressions to test if disagreement is due
 to spouses responding in line with gender norms and customs.
 First, we test if an intervention that projects a cooperative approach
 to maize farming (as opposed to casting maize farming as a typically male
 activity), has an influence on disagreement on the role of women in decision
 making.
 Second, following the reasoning in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "doi:10.1086/703082"

\end_inset

, we expect that disagreement on decision categories will be correlated
 to how these activities are regarded in society.
 Finally, we expect that the intervention will affect disagreement of different
 decision making categories differently depending on how these activities
 are viewed in society, and so also focus on the interaction between the
 treatment and the indicator that reflects what the role of each spouse
 should be in the different decision making categories.

Agreement seems to be highest for the wife's role in spraying.
 This is not surprising because spraying insecticides, fungicides and herbicides
 involves carrying a heavy knapsack sprayer and handling of dangerous substances
, and is generally considered to be the responsibility of the man in the
 household.
 Agreement is lowest for women's labour provision in weeding.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning to disagreement, we see a similar pattern for labour provision than
 we saw for decision making in the previous section, where women tend to
 claim they worked more than what men think.
 T-tests comparing rows 2 and 3 now shows that we reject equality of the
 two disagreement categories for all labour types, again suggesting that
 disagreement is not caused by random measurement error alone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that we can not reject the null hypothesis that disagreement is
 equal across different labour categories (p-value =

We now proceed with a series of regressions to test if disagreement is due
 to information asymmetry within the household.

In fact, they also argue that some decisions may be easier to hide than
 other.
 However, in this study, we assumed decisions are a purely personal thing.

\begin_layout Standard
Results set forth above document substantial spousal disagreement in decision
 making about maize farming, labor contribution, and maize marketing.
 They indicate that the likelihood that co-heads in monogamous maize-farming
 households overstate their own role in decision-making can be reduced by
 reducing intrahousehold information asymmetries and, to a lesser extent,
 by promoting intrahousehold cooperation in farming through a role model
 intervention.
 While results were less clear for the over- and understatement of labor
 contributions, results are more encouraging for the information treatment
 than the treatment projecting cooperative household farming.
 For marketing, promoting cooperation in farming within the household reduced
 the likelihood and degree of one co-head reporting lower sales than what
 the other spouse reported.
 In light of these findings, we explore possible mechanisms that might explain
 our observed patterns of spousal disagreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With respect to differences in reporting related to decision-making, in
 societies or cultures with strong gender norms and customs, co-heads may
 tend to overstate their own role in decision-making due to role congruity

.
 This may also indicate that co-heads claim a larger role within the household,
 in effect claiming recognition for responsibilities taken

.
 The case of co-heads understating their own role in decision-making may
 also be consistent with a range of other possible explanations.
 On one hand, cultural factors may again mean that one co-head plays down
 his or her role and discounts own contribution.
 At the other extreme, one could even imagine situations where the locus
 of decision making is shifted to the other, effectively

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 poor decision-making on the other spouse, for example when, in hindsight,
 the decision turned out to be very bad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results from our intervention suggest that cultural factors play an
 important role in disagreement related to decision making.
 The intervention that promotes a cooperative household farming approach
 with couple role models was expected to challenge traditional views in
 a study region and sociocultural context in which men are assumed to take
 responsibility for maize farming.
 Although these effects were not as robust as expected, we nonetheless generate
 some evidence pointing in this direction.
 At the same time, the fact that we also find significant effects from arming
 both co-heads with equal information may mean that increased monitoring
 reduced the likelihood that spouses would take decisions behind each other's
 back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For labor contributions, cultural factors may also result in one spouse
 claiming to do the bulk of the work, while in reality, the work burden
 may be more equally shared.
 However, it may also indicate imbalance within the relationship, in that
 one spouse performs the bulk of the work without being recognized for it.
 This may often be the case with tedious work such as weeding or domestic
 work and household chores.
 Disagreement characterized by one co-head underreporting own labor contribution
s may point to some degree of shirking.
 For example, it may be that the female co-head does not have a clear idea
 of how long it takes to spray a particular plot and the male co-head exploits
 this information asymmetry by making her believe that it took much longer
 than the time it actually took; the time difference may then be used for
 private activities by the male co-head that do not directly contribute
 to the household as a whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results from our intervention show that only the treatment reducing information
 asymmetry had an impact on disagreement related to spouses' labor contributions.
 This suggests that cultural factors defining gender roles may be less important.
 While the effect of facilitating mutual monitoring on shirking (understating
 labor contributions) is not clear, we do see that arming co-heads with
 information reduces the likelihood that co-heads provide more labor than
 they get credit for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen that some studies interpret cases of overreporting related
 to marketing behavior and income derived from farming activities as signs
 that spouses are hiding income from each other 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "castilla2012ties"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this case, we would have expected that especially the information treatment
 would be more effective in reducing disagreement.
 The fact that we only find an impact from the treatment that promotes a
 cooperative approach suggests that disagreement related to sales is more
 likely related to cultural factors relating to gender roles.
 For instance, our findings may be more consistent with a situation where
 a male co-head exaggerates sales to his spouse because he wants to be seen
 as the provider, but after seeing a video where both spouses are equally
 providing for the household, the male co-head reports sales that are more
 in line with what the female co-head thinks the male co-head sold.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Household surveys that are serious about capturing gender-related heterogeneity
 often try to interview both male and female co-heads separately for at
 least part of the survey.
 This is an important means of reducing biases introduced by the (typically
 male) household head or

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the household, and represents an important advancement in the study
 of intrahousehold dynamics, especially in non-separable agricultural households
 where production and consumption decisions are so closely intertwined.
 A common finding in these surveys is that male and female co-heads often
 give substantially different answers to the same questions.
 While some discordance is inevitable due to measurement error, recent studies
 have been searching for patterns in this disagreement, and suggest that
 systematic disagreement between spouses may be key in understanding intrahouseh
old power dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies on spousal disagreement often use a simple binary variable indicating
 that the answer of one co-head differs (to some degree) from the answer
 of the other co-head.
 In some cases, the direction of disagreement is also considered, differentiatin
g, for instance, between cases where male co-heads report higher levels
 of consumption than female co-heads, and cases where male co-heads report
 lower levels of consumption than female co-heads.
 Often, these questions relate to household-level data, such as consumption
 expenditure or investment in household public goods.
 However, studies interested in women's autonomy and women's empowerment
 go further by asking more personal questions on behaviors and personal
 belongings, and co-heads are typically asked to answer these questions
 about both themselves and their spouses.
 This own and cross-reporting allows for a range of interesting indicators
 of disagreement to be constructed, based primarily on what one co-head
 reports , and what his or her spouse reports about him or her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we focused mostly on directional disagreement indicators
 that exploit questions about behavior of individual spouses obtained from
 both co-heads.
 In addition to documenting patterns in spousal disagreement, we tested
 two interventions aimed at reducing disagreement related to decision-making,
 labor contributions, and marketing in maize farming.
 Both interventions pivoted on the screening of short engaging videos to
 co-heads within the household that both (1) provided viewers with a mental
 image of a cooperative household approach to maize farming through role
 modeling, and (2) reduced information asymmetries between spouses with
 specific technical insights on recommended maize cultivation practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found substantial disagreement between spouses.
 For instance, we found that co-heads exaggerate their own decision-making
 power on almost one in four plots.
 We found statistically significant reductions in the likelihood that co-heads
 overstate their own role in decision making as a result of the intervention
 that promotes a household cooperative approach to farming for decisions
 related to timing of planting and weeding.
 Similarly, we found that reducing information asymmetries between spouses
 led to a reduction in the likelihood that one co-head assigns him- or herself
 more decision-making power than the other spouse claimed.
 The likelihood of understating one's role in decision making was not significan
tly affected by either treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For labor, we found that co-heads seem to relatively overstate their own
 labor and underestimate their spouse's labor.
 However, we also found a substantial part of the sample where a co-head
 reported to work less than what the other spouse thinks (understating of
 own contributions which may point to labor-shirking behavior).
 We found that the likelihood that co-heads overstate own labor contributions
 in a number of farming activities reduced as a result of providing spouses
 with symmetric information that allowed them to better monitor each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For marketing, co-heads tend to overstate own sales, suggesting some degree
 of income hiding.
 At the same time, we did not find an effect of facilitating mutual monitoring.
 Promoting cooperation in farming within the household reduced the likelihood
 and degree of one co-head understating own sales, that is, reporting lower
 sales than what the other spouse assumed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that we found similar effects from both the intervention that projects
 a cooperative household farming approach and the intervention reducing
 information asymmetry suggests that two distinct mechanisms are likely
 at play.
 On one hand, some of the disagreement may be because one co-head overestimates
 his or her own role or position to make it appear in line with prevailing
 expectations, customs, and gender roles.
 Reducing this disagreement will involve longer-run efforts to challenge
 perceptions and gender stereotypes.
 Recent research has found that role models may be particularly effective
 for this 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, some disagreement may reflect deliberate appropriation
 of decisions, shirking, or income hiding.
 Here, interventions aimed at reducing the information disadvantage of one
 spouse, may also be effective.
