Increasing cooperation in agricultural households: Experimental evidence
 from maize farming households in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In smallholder agriculture in developing countries, the household is the
 prevailing unit of production.
 Decision makers in agricultural households have different preferences and
 access to production factors.
 Each member's involvement in activities that benefit the household is also
 affected by prevailing norms and beliefs.
 While many interventions have been focusing on empowering women in agriculture,
 recent research underscores the importance of intra-household cooperation
 as a catalyst to higher household well-being.
 We test two interventions designed to increase intra-household cooperation.
 In one experiment, we assess the effect of reducing information asymmetries
 between spouses by comparing households where the couple received agricultural
 extension information to households where an individual was targeted (either
 the husband of the wife).
 In a second experiment, we investigate the effectiveness of promoting a
 household cooperative approach to farming by showing a video in which both
 spouses are equally involved in maize growing to some households, and compare
 outcomes to households that were shown a video where farming is depicted
 as an individual activity (either done by a man or a woman).

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In subsistence agriculture, the prevailing unit of production is the agricultura
l household, consisting of different household members.
 Within these households, there is generally considerable heterogeneity
 in ownership and control of the different production factors by each member.
 Household members compete as well as co-operate and this has important
 implications for household level outcomes, as preferences are not necessarily
 aligned and some members are likely to have less bargaining power than
 others

.
 We test two different strategies to improve household level outcomes though
 increasing intra-household cooperation among a sample of smallholder maize
 farmers in Uganda.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our first strategy involves reducing information asymmetries within households.
 Agricultural extension information services are generally biased toward
 men.
 Most often, extension officers target the main decision maker with respect
 to agriculture within households, which is generally assumed to be the
 male farmer.
 The assumption that extension messages targeting one household member will
 trickle down to the rest of the household, including women and younger
 household members, may be false.
 Men do not necessarily discuss production decisions or transfer extension
 knowledge to women household members, especially if extension messages
 focus on menâ€™s priorities and crops 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fletschner2011gender"

\end_inset

.
 We compare outcomes in households in which information was given to only
 one of the spouses (either the husband or wife) to outcomes in households
 in which this information was given to both spouses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our second strategy consists of promoting an image of farming as a joint
 venture, with both spouses having an equal role in decision making and
 activities.
 Farming happens in a particular cultural context, and social norms may
 hamper efficient allocation of production factors.
 For instance, it may be that only men are assumed to make decisions on
 certain crops or inputs or only women are allowed to carry out certain
 activities.
 However, norms and customs can change, and role models can be important
 catalysts 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "porter2019gender"

\end_inset

.
 We compare outcomes in households that were shown a video only one spouse
 (either a man or a woman) is involved in farming to outcomes in households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This research aims to generate evidence on the barriers that limit cooperation
 within households.
 The prevalence of the cooperative bargaining models to study gender related
 issues in agriculture has, with its emphasis on outside options and thread
 points, pitched the main decision makers in the household against each
 other.
 Most of the evidence therefore is derived from studies that compare outcomes
 from women owned or managed plots to outcomes of plots owned by the man.
 More recently, the focus has shifted somewhat from intra-household bargaining
 towards cooperation.

\begin_layout Itemize
Does reducing agricultural extension information asymmetries within the
 household improves outcomes at the household level? This research question
 will be answered by comparing outcomes of households in which one adult
 individual (husband or wife) is shown a video with agricultural extension
 information to outcomes of households in which the couple (husband and
 wife together) is shown a video with the same information.
 Refer to who find that joint male and female programme participation leads
 to the highest adoption rates to motivate this experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does promoting a household approach to farming improve outcomes at the household
 level? This research question will be answered by comparing outcomes of
 households that are shown a video with agricultural extension information
 where the messenger is an individual farmer (ie.
 a man or a women) to outcomes of households that are shown a video providing
 the same information by a couple of farmers (ie.
 man and woman who are shown to participate as equals in the family farm
 and deliver the message as a couple)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:Balance_treat1"

\end_inset

 reports a range of orthogonality tests related to the treatment aimed at
 reducing information asymmetries between spouses.
 The first column reports sample means (and standard deviations in parentheses
 below) for the variables indicated to the left, measured at baseline.
 For instance, we found that at the time of baseline data collection, average
 yields in the sample amounted to about 264 kg per acre.
 Average age of the household head in our sample is 40 years and only about
 36 percent reported to have finished primary education.
 The average household has more than 7 members who live in a house with
 2.2 bedrooms.
 Only 11 percent had access to agricultural extension in the preceding year,
 about 20 percent used (inorganic) fertilizer and almost 40 percent reported
 to have used improved seed.
 Average distance to the nearest agro-input dealer is 5.5 km and almost 80
 percent of households own a mobile phone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second column, we report differences in means at baseline between
 households that received the extension information as a couple and households
 where only one of the spouses (either the husband of the wife) received
 the information.
 We find significant imbalance on various baseline characteristics.
 For instance, we see that in the sub-sample of households that were given
 the information as a couple, the household head is almost 4 years older
 than in households where the information was given to only one of the spouses.
 Household heads in households that were treated as a couple are also significan
tly more likely to have finished primary education by about 8 percentage
 points.
 We further find that these households are about 10 percentage points more
 likely to own a mobile phone and 5 percent less likely to have used fertilizer.
 We also have some indications that access to extension and households size
 is correlated with the treatment.
 A test for joint orthogonality also indicates that there are significant
 differences in baseline characteristics between the groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next two columns splits up the control group, and compares baseline
 characteristics for households where couples were provided with information
 to (a) households where only the men received this information (column
 2) and (b) only the women received this information (column 3).
 We see that most of the imbalance in the first column is a result of imbalance
 between households were couples were treated and households were only the
 wife was treated.
 Household heads in households were only the women was shown the video are
 more than 8 years younger than in households where the couple was treated.
 Households that received the information as a couple were 20 percentage
 points more likely to own a mobile phone that in households where only
 the woman was shown the video.
 Household heads in the former group were almost 17 percentage points more
 likely to report to have finished primary education that in the latter
 group.
 While imbalance seems to be less of a problem when comparing households
 where couples were treated to households where only men got the information,
 we still reject the joint null of no difference in baseline characteristics.

It is unclear why we find this imbalance.
 The most likely explanation may be related to the availability of the person
 or persons to whom the video needed to be shown.
 Prior to the intervention, all nuclear households in the selected villages
 were listed.
 These lists were then used to carry out the randomization.
 The names of the household heads were uploaded on the tablet computers
 which instructed the enumerator to confirm he or she was showing the video
 to the correct household member (the husband, the wife, or the husband
 and wife together).
 However, we also had backup lists with replacement households from which
 survey supervisors could select if the selected household could not be
 interviewed (for instance, it often happened that a selected household
 appeared to be polygamous).
 It may be that it was harder to get men within the households, such that
 when the couple treatment or man only treatment needed to be administered,
 more was relied on the backup list.
 If absent men have different characteristics (for instance, they are younger,
 better educated and more likely to have a phone), this may lead to the
 observed imbalance.
 We do indeed see that the use of the backup list was significantly lower
 when the video needed to be shown to only the wife.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
we may want to explore how the use of a replacement list may have been driving
 this.
 We have data on whether the original household was interviewed of not:

At the same time, the imbalance persists even after removing all households
 that were taken from the backup lists.
 We will control for imbalance in the analysis of the endline data below.

 Also here, the first column reports means and standard deviations, copied
 from Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The second column now compares households where the information was provided
 by a couple to households that got to see a video in which the information
 was given by only one individual, either a man or a woman.
 Similar to Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the next two columns split up the comparison group, and now compare the
 baseline characteristics for households that saw the couple video to (a)
 households were only a man gives all the information (column 3) and to
 (b) households were only a woman gives all the information (column 3).
 For this treatment, we find balance among almost all baseline characteristics
 and also can never reject joint orthogonality.

Jointness and cooperation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are various reasons why attention has shifted from bargaining to cooperati
on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, new models are less fixated on bargaining.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doss2015collective"

\end_inset

 point out that households face collective action problems similar to those
 studied in the context of common pool resources management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, it is not always clear who manages the plot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, recent research suggests much can be won by increasing intra-household
 cooperation.
 Somewhat indirectly, the WEAI can be used, as empowerment is likely to
 be correlated to decision making.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "seymour2017women"

\end_inset

 finds that technical efficiency is higher when the empowerment gap between
 wife and husband is lower.
 At the same time, there is only a weak association between women empowerment
 and technical efficiency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fourth, and more of a conceptual nature, it remains unclear what empowerment
 means and how best to achieve it in a given context.
 Often, women empowerment in agriculture is operationalized as the ability
 to make more decisions themselves on their own plots, from which proceeds
 can be derived for their own benefit.

 the expense of men's and/or joint decisions consists of women empowerment.

household level outcomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by looking at standard household level outcomes used in assessing
 the impact of agricultural extension information.
 A traditional theory of change assumes that an increase in information
 would lead to increased adoption of recommended agronomic practices, which
 in turn affects production and ultimately well-being.
 We first report results of the experiment where we reduce information asymmetri
es, and then present results for the experiment that promotes are household
 cooperative approach.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first outcome we consider is knowledge.
 Knowledge at the household level is assessed by the likelihood that both
 spouses are able to indicate the correct response on multiple choice question.
 We tested knowledge with four carefully chosen multiple choice questions
 that were asked to each spouse individually.
 One question tests technical knowledge about a new agronomic practice that
 was shown in the video, while another question asked about a practice that
 was assumed to be known by most farmers.
 A third question focused less on technical detail, but wanted to assess
 if farmers also absorbed the broader message in the video that successful
 farmers approach maize growing as a business, which involves planning,
 foresight, risk taking and investment.
 A final question was on a topic on which no information was provided in
 the video and was added to verify the effectiveness of the video.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using an index based on these questions, we do not find that reducing informatio
n asymmetry significantly increased knowledge at the household level.
 This null result may indicate that the information treatment was not effective
 and/or that information is shared efficiently within the household.
 Following the first explanation of this null result, we do find that reducing
 information asymmetry increases the likelihood that both spouses know the
 recommended spacing and seed rate (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowledge"

\end_inset

, first row, column 2).
 As can be seen in column 1, average knowledge about this particular topic
 is very low: only in about 6 percent of households, both spouses were able
 to select the correct option on the multiple choice question on recommended
 seed rate and spacing.
 From this, we conclude that reducing information asymmetries may be effective
 for increasing household level knowledge if the information concerns new
 practices or technologies and the potential for learning is high.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second outcome is adoption of improved agronomic practices.
 Here we construct an index from 4 practices; details can be found in Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:practices"

\end_inset

.
 The first practice is timely planting.
 Maize should be planted at the onset of the rains.
 We have asked each spouse how many days after the start of the rains the
 maize was planted on each maize plot.
 To arrive at a measure at the household level, we first take the average
 of the responses of the spouses at plot level, and than take averages over
 plots.
 We find that maize is planted about 4 days after the onset of the rains.
 The next three practices are all assessed using a binary variable, that
 takes the value of 1 if at least one spouse reports that the practice was
 applied on at least one plot within the household.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do not find a significant difference in the adoption of recommended practices
 between households where both spouses are shown the video together and
 households where only one of the spouses was shown the video.
 We do find that adoption of the new way of spacing and planting maize is
 adopted by 3.3 percentage points more households that were shown the video
 as a couple as compared to within households where only one of the spouses
 was shown the video, but the difference is not significant.
 The difference becomes significant if we decompose the effect and compare
 households where the couple received the video treatment and only women
 received the information.
 This may indicate that women within the household have insufficient agency
 to implement knowledge gained.
 As a result, from a policy perspective, it is important to include the
 husband in extension campaigns if the focus is on household level adoption
 of new practices.
 There are also indications that timely weeding was more common among households
 where only one individual was shown the video, especially if the information
 was only provided to a woman (although differences are not statistically
 significant after controlling family wise error rates).
 This may be because weeding does not require a lot of consultation among
 spouses and so this information can easily be acted upon by the woman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third we look the use of modern inputs.
 For fertilizer, the index summarizes the use of three types of fertilizer
 (DAP/NPK, urea and organic fertilizer).
 For each type, an indicator is calculated that is true if at least one
 spouse indicated that the particular type of fertilizer was used on at
 least on of the maize plots that were cultivated by the household.
 We find that, according to the index, reducing information asymmetries
 increases fertilizer use, although the effect is only significant at a
 10 percent significance level.
 Analysis of the use of different types, reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:inputs"

\end_inset

, show that the impact is driven by an increase in the likelihood that household
s use organic fertilizer.
 For seed use, the index aggregates hybrid seed and open pollinated varieties.
 We do not find that improved seed use changed significantly after reducing
 intra-household information asymmetry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then look at production related outcomes.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HH_impact_info_asym"

\end_inset

 shows no impact of showing a video to a couple as opposed to showing the
 video only to one of the spouses.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:production"

\end_inset

 shows results for the different components of the index, but also here,
 no statistically significant differences are found.
 Finally, we want to know if efforts to increase intra-household cooperation
 also led to an increase in household level well-being.
 Questions related to well-being were only asked to the wife, as she is
 most likely the one responsible for reproductive chores.
 We asked subjective well-being questions where households were asked to
 compare themselves over time and relative to others in the village.
 We also use self-assessed food security (using two questions from the Household
 Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS)).
 We also use food consumption as a proxy for household level well-being.
 Results show reducing information asymmetries within the household does
 not impact well-being.

Decision making
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now provide an extensive analysis of the decision making process within
 the households in our sample.
 First, we analyze a series of plot level decisions related to maize farming.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each activity that needed to be decided upon, we develop a plot level
 indicator of joint decision making that takes the value of one if both
 spouses indicate that the decision was made by husband and wife jointly.
 This is than divided by the number of maize plots within that household
 to arrive at the share of plots that were jointly decided on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first key decision we look at is the decision to plant maize on the particular
 plot (as opposed to planting other crops or leaving it fallow).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Conflict resolution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spouses may disagree about certain maize production activities.
 We ask each spouse separately whether, in case of disagreement about any
 maize related issue, they would tell their spouse.
 Respondents were allowed to indicate the likeliness that they would tell
 the other spouse on a scale of 1 (never) to 5 (always).
 Table X reports results for 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that in almost 32 percent of households, both spouses indicate that
 they always tell each other when there is disagreement.
 In less than 6 percent of households, both spouses report that they never
 tell each other.

As a result, from a policy perspective, it is important to include the husband
 in extension campaigns if the focus is on household level adoption of new
 practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agricultural household models do not behave as a unit.
 Outcomes are a result of bargaining over scarce resources.
 However, a focus on individual level outcomes has resulted in policies
 and projects focusing too much on empowering women, often through providing
 them with exclusive control over resources.
 This exclusive focus on women may bring about adverse effects including
 jealously and distrust in the household, in some cases leading to domestic
 violence, husbands withdrawing from providing for the household as they
 feel less responsible, or even reduced womenâ€™s decision-making power in
 particular domains 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2014impact"

\end_inset

.
 A focus on womenâ€™s control over resources risks to move ever further away
 from the essence of empowerment which revolves around balancing power relations
 and which re-lies on shifts in consciousness and changes in structural
 constraints to gender equity (Cornwall 2016).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another advantage is that if the focus is on women empowerment, there is
 only one way in: the woman.
 If the focus is on cooperation, we can work also through the husband.

 standard error) with its corresponding p-value in column 2; column 3 reports
 differences between video+ivr and video+ivr+SMS (and standard error) with
 its corresponding p-value in column 4; sample size is reported in column
 5.
 Reported p-values are based on randomization inference (10,000 permutations);
 ***, ** and * denote that the difference is signficant at the 1, 5 and
 10 percent level, respectively, after correcting for multiple hypothesis
 testing using a family-wise sharp null (10,000 permutations).
 All specifications control for the other orthogonal factors in the factorial
 design.
 Additional controls for the IVR treatment are  age of household head at
 baseline, household size at baseline and number of bedrooms at baseline.
 Additional controls for the SMS treatment are  number of bedrooms at baseline.
