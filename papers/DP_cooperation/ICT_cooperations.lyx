Increasing cooperation in agricultural households: Experimental evidence
 from maize farming households in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In smallholder agriculture in developing countries, the household is the
 prevailing unit of production.
 These households are composed of different individuals, each with their
 own preferences and access to resources, who operate in a context governed
 by particular norms and beliefs.
 Household members both cooperate and compete to maximize a utility function
 that includes both individual and household level well-being.
 We test two interventions designed to increase spousal cooperation.
 The first targets cognitive channels and estimates the impact of reducing
 differences in the information available to each spouse.
 The second targets non-cognitive skills, encouraging household members
 to approach maize farming as a household business, thereby challenging
 social norms and gender stereotypes that men and women should engage in
 different activities.
 We find that reducing intra-household information asymmetries increases
 joint decision making, reduces the labor time gap between spouses, increases
 the intention to jointly invest in agriculture, and increases communication
 among spouses.
 We find no effects on household level production outcomes.
 We find no effect of promoting a household cooperative approach to maize
 farming.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In subsistence agriculture, the prevailing unit of production is the agricultura
l household.
 However, these households consist of different household members, each
 with their own utility functions and access to resources.
 The preferences of the different household members may not perfectly align,
 and there may be considerable inequality in access to resources.
 Research shows that this often results in inefficient allocation of production
 factors within these households.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "udry1996gender"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 finds significant differences in productivity between man managed and women
 managed plots due to the fact that more fertilizer and labor is allocated
 to man managed plots.
 Given diminishing returns to especially fertilizer use, he finds that reallocat
ing production factors from man managed to women managed plots may increase
 household level productivity by 6 percent.
 The realization that household members compete as well as cooperate has
 led to a burgeoning literature grounded in collective bargain theory, with
 the important policy implication being that interventions may have different
 impact depending on who is targeted within the household 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "New1,haddad1997intrahousehold"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Many interventions started to target women within households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, the focus has shifted somewhat, focusing less on intra-household
 competition and more on cooperation between household members.
 This is partly due to the fact that alternative models of the household
 have been proposed that provide more room for intra-household cooperation.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doss2015collective"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 point out that households face collective action problems similar to those
 studied in the context of common pool resources management.
 Furthermore, many resources are jointly owned and decisions jointly made,
 and so the clear division between man managed and women managed plots underlyin
g bargaining models may be the exception rather that the rule

key "doss2014owns,twyman2015gendered,doi:10.1111/dpr.12243"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 For some time now, the literature on measuring women empowerment has been
 stressing that unilateral decisions made by a women within the household
 should not always be strictly preferred to instances where decisions are
 taken together 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "alkire2013women"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we test two different strategies to improve various outcomes
 though increasing intra-household cooperation among a sample of smallholder
 maize farmers in Uganda.
 Each strategy targets a different impact pathway.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first strategy involves reducing information asymmetries within households.
 Informational frictions are important barriers to agricultural technology
 adoption and sustainable intensification 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "magruder2018assessment"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Access to information and ensuing knowledge may be unequally distributed
 between spouses within the household, which may reduce the likelihood that
 spouses cooperate in an effective way.
 We test the effectiveness of reducing information gaps between spouses
 by comparing outcomes in households in which information was made available
 to only one of the spouses—the husband or wife—to outcomes in households
 in which this information was made available to both spouses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second strategy consists of promoting a mental image of farming as a
 joint venture, with both spouses having an equal role in decision making,
 activities, and rewards.
 Farming happens in a particular cultural context, and social norms may
 hamper efficient allocation of production factors.
 For instance, in patrilineal societies it may be that only men are assumed
 to make decisions on certain crops, or only women are allowed to carry
 out certain activities.
 However, norms and customs can change, and role models have been found
 to be important catalysts 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "porter2019gender"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 We therefore devise an intervention aimed at promoting a cooperative approach
 to farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Central to both treatments are short, engaging videos that were produced
 with a dual purpose.
 First, the videos are designed to provide information on a range of yield
 increasing agricultural management practices such as timely planting, seed
 spacing and seed rate, and strategies to deal with striga, a parasitic
 weed that is a major threat to maize in the area.
 The videos also recommend the use of modern inputs such as fertilizer and
 improved seed.
 Second, the videos are designed to change a range of non-cognitive personality
 traits, such as aspirations, locus-of-control, and attitudes to change,
 of the persons that view the video.
 In particular, the videos bring the story of a farmer that used to struggle
 with low maize yields and, after a particularly bad year, decides things
 need to change.
 It is then shown how the farmer uses recommended practices and improved
 inputs.
 It is explained that becoming a successful farmer takes time, and money
 needs to be invested now to get better results in the future.
 The video ends with the image of a successful farmer assuring the viewer
 that he or she can also become successful by following the advice provided
 in the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the first intervention–reducing intra-household information
 asymmetries–increases joint decision making on a range of agronomic practices.
 We also find that there is an increase in the likelihood that spouses jointly
 decide to use fertilizer.
 The intervention also reduces the gap between labor time contributed by
 the wife and labor time contributed by the husband.
 Furthermore, reducing intra-household information asymmetries increases
 the likelihood that both spouses prioritize investment in agriculture.
 There is also evidence that spouses are more likely to tell each other
 if they disagree about something related to agriculture when information
 asymmetry is reduced.
 We find no effects on household level production outcomes.
 The second intervention–projecting a cooperative approach to maize farming–also
 does not appear to have much impact.
 This may be because farmers are unable to identify with the role models
 in the video.
 It may also be that the treatment is too light to have an impact through
 non-cognitive pathways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The next section presents
 the research questions, the interventions we use to test the research hypothese
s, and the underlying theory of change.
 We then present the experimental design and test pre-treatment balance
 between the different treatment groups on a range of household characteristics.
 We then turn to the results, first looking at how the interventions affect
 joint decision making.
 We then test if increasing cooperation also leads to a more equitable distribut
ion of labor.
 As changes in aspirations have been found to affect forward looking behavior
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bernard2014future"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, we also look at the impact of the interventions on intentions to invest
 proceeds from maize farming.
 We then explore household level outcomes.
 A next section explores spousal disagreement and we also report effects
 on the likelihood that farmers tell each other in the event of disagreement.
 A final section concludes.

 Also in the context of smallholder agriculture, it has been argued that
 a lack of information about the existence, use, and profitability of modern
 inputs and recommended practices is a major constraint to sustainable crop
 intensification

 Due to its public, non-rival nature, agricultural extension information
 is generally under-supplied by the private sector, and so governments across
 the developing world have started to provide extension information as a
 public service.

 Information may benefit one spouse more than the other, may be monopolized

One hypothesis we will test is therefore whether reducing information asymmetrie
s between spouses may lead to different outcomes.
 There are various reasons why this may be the case.
 It may be that when both spouses receive information, spouses discuss and
 reflect on this information, making it more likely that they also act upon
 it.
 For example In addition, borrowing from research on common pool resource
 management, if both spouses have the same information, they can monitor
 each other, which strengthens incentives for contributions to the common
 (household level) goods and discourages over-consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doss2015collective"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, a reduction in information asymmetry also reduces the ability
 to monopolize or conceal information by one of the spouses.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Maybe this should be extended: Are these all the impact pathways we can
 think of? Should we tie this better in the literature.
 Most importantly, can we connect this to the analysis (eg the monitoring
 pathway can be approximated by spousals disagreement, increased communication
 may be proxied by the likelihood that they tell each other that they disagree,
 maybe we can also do something with knowledge to look at monopolization).
 Should this even be here or better in a separate section, as these impact
 pathways may also to a more or less extent be important for the second
 intervention? One thing we can do is remove the knowledge from the aggregate
 results and put a separate knowledge monopolization impact pathway part.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a second hypothesis, we will therefore test whether projecting a household
 cooperative approach to farming leads to better outcomes.
 Also here, we posit different impact pathways.
 First, there may be aspirational effects of seeing a couple farming maize
 successfully together.
 The intervention may also serve to challenge social norms and gender roles
 that prescribe that men specialize in productive and women in reproductive
 activities.
 This may lead women to become more assertive when men take decisions or
 it may make men more open to women participation in farming.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Also here, can we look more into mechanisms? Unfortunately, we threw out
 all questions that attempted to measure aspirations, but maybe we can argue
 that the decision to invest in agriculture is indicative of an aspirational
 effect?

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Interventions and Experimental design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both experiments are implemented using short videos that were shown to farmers
 on tablet computers.
 The videos were designed with a dual purpose in mind.
 First, the videos serve to transfer knowledge about recommended agronomic
 management practices and the use of modern technologies.
 It is shown how fields need to be prepared using organic fertilizer.
 Proper seed spacing and seeding rates and it importance are explained.
 furthermore, it is shown in detail how inorganic fertilizer needs to be
 applied and in what quantities.
 Furthermore, attention is devoted to identifying striga, a parasitic weed
 that affects maize yields in the area.
 We also devote ample attention to the importance of seed quality and recommend
 using hybrid seed or Open Pollinated Varieties (OPV).
 Other recommended practices include timely planting and weeding.
 Second, the information was packaged as an inspirational story of poor
 farmers that, over time, are able to break out of a poverty trap.
 The video starts with a farmer explaining that he used to struggle with
 low yields, producing barely enough food to feed his family, but that over
 the years, he learned how to increase the number of bags of maize produced
 on his maize plots.
 It is shown how the farmer starts using recommended practices on a small
 part of his land.
 It is also shown how he sells a chicken and borrows some money from a neighbor
 to buy improved seed and fertilizer.
 The return on this initial investment is then re-invested, and the viewer
 is taken through some basic inter-temporal cost-benefit calculations.
 The video ends by showing a happy farmer that assures the viewer that he
 or she can also become a successful farmer by following his example.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer the first research question–whether reducing information asymmetry
 within households is effective–we compare outcomes of households in which
 the couple (husband and wife together) is shown a video to outcomes of
 households in which with only one co-head of the household (husband or
 wife) is shown the video.
 To answer the second research question–whether promoting a household cooperativ
e approach to farming is effective–we compare outcomes of households where
 an aspirational video was shown in which a man and woman participate as
 equals on the family farm and deliver the message as a couple to outcomes
 of households where where an aspirational video was shown featuring only
 a man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The field experiment was carried out among a random sample of maize farmers
 in eastern Uganda.
 Two-stage cluster sampling was used to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, from five districts (Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo,
 and Namutumba), we first selected 50 parishes randomly and in proportion
 to the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all the households, from which we sampled
 10 households to be included in the study.
 About 3,300 households participated in the first experiment; about 2,200
 in the second experiment.

This is a very low yield; during focus group discussions, we learned that

 Average age of the household head in our sample is 40 years and only about

 Only 11 percent had access to agricultural extension in the preceding year,
 about 20 percent used (inorganic) fertilizer and almost 40 percent reported
 to have used improved seed.

 shows the average share of plots on which decisions are made (1) jointly,
 (2) by the husband alone, and (3) by the wife alone for seven key decisions.
 For (1), we classified the decision as having been taken jointly if both
 spouses agree that the decision was taken jointly.
 For (2), a decision was classified as taken by the husband if the husband
 reported that he unilaterally decided and for (3), a decision was classified
 as taken by the wife if the wife reported that she unilaterally decided.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see that decision making patterns are similar across most management
 practices, but that men are more likely to make decisions related to input
 use.
 For decisions related to timing of planting, seeds spacing and seed rate,
 managing striga and timing of first weeding (barplots 2 to 5), shares of
 plots on which decisions are taken jointly are in line with the decision
 to plant maize on the plot in the first place (reported in the first barplot
 of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision-making"

\end_inset

).
 Furthermore, for these activities, the share of plots on which these decisions
 are taken by the man alone is very close to the share of plots on which
 these decisions are taken jointly, and range between 27 and 36 percent
 of the plots.
 The proportion of plots on which women say they make decisions on planting,
 timing, spacing, striga management, and weeding ranges from 13 to 18 percent.
 Overall, patterns are according to expectations, with women somewhat more
 important for decisions related to weeding and men more likely to decide
 on spacing.
 Already, a sizable part of decisions are made jointly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decision to use fertilizer (barplot 6), and the decision to use improved
 seed especially (barplot 7), seems to be more likely to be made by the
 husband alone.
 For instance, on 41 percent of the plots where fertilizer was used, this
 decision was made by the man alone.
 The decision to use improved seed is made jointly on only 12 percent of
 the plots.
 This suggests that new technologies, especially if these need to be purchased
 on the market, remain the domain of the husband.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 summarizes the impact of the two interventions on joint decision making
 (again defined as the share of plots on which both spouses report that
 the decision to implement a particular practice or to use a certain input
 was made jointly).
 We consider the same set of decisions as in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision-making"

\end_inset

.
 We report point estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals for the differenc
e in the share of plots on which each of these 7 decisions were made jointly
 (expressed in standard deviations to facilitate comparisons within and
 across figures).
 In dark blue, we report differences in joint decision making between households
 where information was provided to both spouses (the treatment group), and
 joint decision making in households where information was given to only
 one of the spouses (either the husband or the wife; the comparison group).
 In light blue, we report differences in joint decision making between household
s where the information was provided by a couple (the treatment group) and
 joint decision making in households where information was given by a man
 (the comparison group).
 While we find no impact of the second treatment, reducing information asymmetry
 significantly increases joint decision making related to the decision to
 plant maize on the plot, on strategies to fight striga, on the timing of
 the first weeding, and on the use of fertilizer.

 provides more detail.
 In the first column, sample averages are shown (with standard deviations
 in brackets below).
 For instance, we see that overall, the decision to cultivate maize is taken
 jointly on 36 percent of the plots.
 In the second column, we see that this share is almost 10 percentage points
 higher in the subgroup of households where the video was shown to both
 spouses together than in the subgroup of households where the video was
 shown to only one of the spouses (either the husband of the wife).
 This difference is significantly different from zero at a p-value of 0.007
 (reported in column 3) as determined by randomization inference and remains
 significant at the 5 percent level after accounting for multiple hypothesis
 testing using a family-wise sharp null.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decision on when to start planting is taken jointly on 32 percent of
 the plots.
 This decision is made jointly on an additional 2 percent of plots (correspondin
g to a 6 percent increase) among household where information asymmetry was
 reduced, but the increase is not significant.
 The decision on spacing is also taken jointly on 32 percent of the plots.
 Also for this decision, the rate increases after the treatment, but not
 significantly.
 Next, we find that decisions related to strategies to fight striga are
 taken jointly on 27 percent of maize plots.
 This percentage is almost 7 percentage points higher (corresponding to
 an increase of 26 percent) among households where both spouses were shown
 a video than among households where only one spouse got the information.
 We also find that the decision on when to start weeding is taken jointly
 on a significantly higher share of plots after reducing information asymmetries
 between spouses.
 Results for the second intervention are shown in the fifth column of Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, also assessed as the difference between treatment and control (with standard
 error in brackets below).
 We find that, in general, promoting a cooperative approach also increases
 joint decision making, but differences are never statistically significant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To account for multiple hypothesis testing, we also calculate an index based
 on the five different practices on which was decided jointly.
 In particular, we follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "anderson2008multiple"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and construct an inverse covariance weighted index that ensures that outcomes
 that are highly correlated with each other receive less weight, while outcomes
 that are uncorrelated and thus represent new information receive more weight.
 Judged by this index, we confirm that reducing information gaps between
 spouses increases joint decision making about agronomic practices.
 There is no impact from the intervention that aims to promote a cooperative
 approach using role models.

 also shows results for decisions related to input use.
 These are treated separately, as questions on who decided on input use
 were only asked in households that reported to use the input.
 For instance, we find that fertilizer was used in only 509 households in
 our sample.
 Among these households, the decision to use fertilizer was taken jointly
 on about 21 percent of the plots.
 For the first treatment, we see that this percentage is about 15 percentage
 points higher in the treatment group than in the control group.
 We do not find a significant effect for the second treatment.
 Furthermore, we find no effects from either treatment on the likelihood
 that the decision to use improved seed was made jointly.

 Figure

 shows time worked on various key task in maize growing.
 In particular, we ask the husband and wife separately how many man-days
 he or she spent on preparing land, planting, weeding, spraying, and harvesting.
 Households spent most time on weeding.
 Furthermore, households spent on average 23 days preparing land.
 We find that, generally, there is not much difference in labor time between
 spouses.
 Summing over all activities, women work about 40 days in maize farming,
 men work about 39 days.
 We do see some differences according to gender, with men spending on average
 one day more on land preparation than women, and women spending on average
 2 days more on weeding than men.
 Spraying, which often involves carrying has heavy knapsack sprayer, is
 also generally done by men.

Figure

 Full results corresponding to this figure can be found in the top panel
 of Table

reference "tab:time_use_full"

.
 Again, the first column reports sample means for these differences.
 Generally, women work more than man and the difference is positive, except
 for land preparation and spraying.
 We find that reducing information asymmetry reduces the gap between time
 spend by the wife and time spent by the husband.
 The reduction is significantly different from zero for time spent on preparing
 the land and on total labor time.
 When we use randomization inference to judge significance, we also find
 a significant reduction in the difference in time allocated to harvesting.
 However, for most other activities, the gap also seems to reduce in response
 to the first treatment.
 Promoting a cooperative approach to maize farming, reported in column 5,
 does not seem to affect the labor time gap between wife and husband.

In the second and third panel of Table

, we provide further information on how the labor time gap is reduced by
 looking at difference in labor provision for each of the spouses separately.
 In the middle panel, we report the impact of the interventions on the time
 the husband reported to be spending on each activity.
 While none of the differences are significant, we do see that time spent
 by the man increases over all activities.
 In total, men in households that were shown the video as a couple work
 about 1.2 man-days more that in households where the video was shown to
 only one individual.
 In the bottom panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:time_use_full"

\end_inset

, we see sizable reductions in time spent by the wife after information
 asymmetry is reduced.
 Women spent more then four days less in total, with large reductions in
 time spent on weeding, and on land preparation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the second treatment, we find that time reduces for both husband and
 wife, but differences are never significant, except perhaps for the wife's
 time spent on planting.
 This could be because row planting is an activity that probably benefits
 most from cooperation and indeed, in the video where a household cooperative
 approach is promoted, it is shown how husband and wife together rig a wire
 to arrive at proper plant spacing.
 However, the difference is only significant at the 10 percent level.

 investment in non-agricultural business, and savings.
 There was also a separate category that attempts to measure adult goods

 over-investment in man controlled plots, there are substantial productivity

 We therefore also test if increasing intra-household cooperation increases
 household level outcomes.
 We look at outcomes typically used in assessing the impact of agricultural

 A traditional theory of change assumes that an increase in information
 would lead to increased adoption of recommended agronomic practices and
 use of modern inputs, which in turn affects production, and ultimately
 well-being.

\begin_layout Standard
Following a traditional theory of change, the first outcome we consider
 is knowledge.
 We tested knowledge with four carefully chosen multiple choice questions
 that were asked to each spouse individually.
 One question tests technical knowledge about a new agronomic practice that
 was shown in the video, while another question asked about a practice that
 was assumed to be known by most farmers, but not universally practiced.
 A third question focused less on technical detail, but wanted to assess
 if farmers also absorbed the broader message in the video that successful
 farmers approach maize growing as a business, which involves planning,
 foresight, risk taking, and investment outlays.
 A final question was on a topic on which no information was provided in
 the video and was added to verify the effectiveness of the video.
 Knowledge at the household level is assessed by the likelihood that at
 least one of the spouses is able to indicate the correct response on the
 multiple choice question.
 Using an index based on these four questions, we do not find that reducing
 information asymmetry significantly increased knowledge at the household
 level.
 We also find no effect of the second treatment on household level knowledge.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This null result may indicate that the information treatment was not effective
 in changing the knowledge we measure using the index and/or that information
 is shared efficiently within the household.
 We find support for both explanations.
 On the one hand, looking into the different components of the index, we
 find that reducing information asymmetry does increase the likelihood that
 both spouses know the recommended spacing and seed rate (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowledge"

\end_inset

, first row, column 2).
 As can be seen in column 1, average knowledge about this particular topic
 is very low: only in about 6 percent of households, both spouses were able
 to select the correct option on the multiple choice question.
 From this, we conclude that reducing information asymmetries may be effective
 for increasing household level knowledge if the information concerns new
 practices or technologies and the potential for learning is high.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that knowledge on what to do against fall armyworm is similarly low.
 But recall that here we did not expect to find an impact as the intervention
 does not provide information on this topic.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 On the other hand, if we split the comparison group into two according
 to gender, we find that the difference becomes insignificant if we compare
 knowledge of households where couples were treated to households where
 men alone were treated (column 4), but remains significant between households
 where couples were treated and households where only women were treated
 (column 6).
 Consistent with the existence of information spillovers within the household,
 we find that in households where the husband alone was shown the video,
 81 percent say they discussed the video with their wife.
 Among households where only the wife was shown the video, only 71 percent
 say they discussed the video with their husband (and this difference is
 significant at p<0.001 using Fisher's exact test).
 In other words, information seems to be shared less if targeted to the
 wife only.
 We do not find that projecting a household approach affected knowledge
 at the household level.
 Also when looking at the components of the index individually (column 7
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowledge"

\end_inset

), we do not find an impact.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second outcome family collects outcomes related to the adoption of the
 improved agronomic practices that were recommended in the video (see also
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision-making"

\end_inset

).
 Here, we construct an index from 4 practices; details can be found in Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:practices"

\end_inset

.
 The first practice is timely planting.
 Maize should be planted at the onset of the rains.
 We have asked each spouse how many days after the start of the rains the
 maize was planted on each maize plot.
 To arrive at a measure at the household level, we first take the average
 of the responses of the spouses at plot level, and then take averages over
 plots.
 Using this measure, we find that maize on the average plot is planted about
 4 days after the onset of the rains.
 The next three practices–the use of the recommended seeds spacing and seed
 rate, the recommended way to fight striga, and optimal timing of first
 weeding–are all assessed using simple yes/no questions asked to each spouse
 individually for each plot.
 To aggregate these outcomes at the household level, we take a generous
 approach and construct a household level indicator that takes the value
 of one if at least one spouse reports that the practice was adopted on
 at least one plot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do not find a significant difference in the adoption of recommended practices
 between households where both spouses are shown the video together and
 households where only one of the spouses was shown the video.
 Looking at Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:practices"

\end_inset

, we see that reducing information asymmetries also reduced average time
 between the first rain and planting by almost one day, but the effect is
 not significant.
 We also find that adoption of the new way of spacing and planting maize
 is adopted by 3.2 percentage points more households that were shown the
 video as a couple as compared to within households where only one of the
 spouses was shown the video, but also here the difference is not significant.
 There are also indications that timely weeding was more common among households
 where only one individual was shown the video.
 Also here, we do not find any significant impact of the second treatment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third we look the use of modern inputs: fertilizer and improved maize seed.
 For fertilizer, the index in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HH_impact_info_asym"

\end_inset

 summarizes the use of three types: DAP/NPK, urea, and organic fertilizer.
 We again define input use at the household level generously: for each type
 of fertilizer, an indicator is calculated that is true if at least one
 spouse indicated that the particular type of fertilizer was used on at
 least one of the maize plots.
 We find that, according to the index, reducing information asymmetries
 increases fertilizer use, although the effect is only significant at a
 10 percent significance level.
 Analysis of the use of different types, reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:inputs"

\end_inset

, show that the impact is driven by an increase in the likelihood that household
s use organic fertilizer.
 For seed use, the index aggregates hybrid seed and Open Pollinated Varieties.
 We do not find that improved seed use changed significantly after reducing
 intra-household information asymmetry.
 Promoting a household cooperative approach does not seem to affect household
 level input use if judged by the indices.
 The use of hybrid seed seems to be somewhat higher among households that
 saw a video featuring a couple role model.
 However, the difference is not statistically significant after controlling
 Family Wise Error rates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then look at production related outcomes.
 The index summarized in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HH_impact_info_asym"

\end_inset

 was calculated from household level production, area (included in the index
 as a negative outcome since we are interested in intensification where
 more is produced on less land), and a subjective assessment of productivity.
 Household level production was estimated by taking the average between
 plot level production reported by man and woman, and them summing production
 over all plots within the household.
 Following our pre-analysis plan, we then take logarithms and trim at 5
 percent.
 Similarly, for area, we take averages of plot level area estimates between
 spouses, sum to obtain household level estimates, and use trimmed logarithms.
 The subjective question takes the form of a binary variable that takes
 the value of one if any spouse reports better yield on any plot than normal.
 In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:production"

\end_inset

, where we shows results for the different components of the index, we also
 include yield (defined as kilograms produced per acre).
 We find no impact of showing a video to a couple as opposed to showing
 the video only to one of the spouses.
 We also find no impact of showing a video that uses a couple as a role
 model compared to a video that depicts farming as a male activity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we want to know if efforts to increase intra-household cooperation
 affected household level well-being.
 Questions related to well-being were only asked to the wife, as she is
 most likely the one responsible for reproductive chores.
 We asked subjective well-being questions where households were asked to
 compare themselves over time and relative to others in the village.
 We also use self-assessed food security (using two questions from the Household
 Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS)).
 We also use food consumption as a proxy for household level well-being.
 The indices in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HH_impact_info_asym"

\end_inset

 show neither treatment has an effect on household level well-being.
 Detailed results are in Appendix Table

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Conflict resolution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spouses may disagree about certain maize production activities.
 We ask each spouse separately whether, in case of disagreement about any
 maize related issue, they would tell their spouse.
 Respondents were allowed to indicate the likeliness that they would tell
 the other spouse on a scale of 1 (never) to 5 (always).
 Overall, we find that in almost 32 percent of households, both spouses
 indicate that they always tell each other when there is disagreement.
 In less than 6 percent of households, both spouses report that they never
 tell each other.

 We see that among households where the video was shown to both spouses,
 there is an increase in the proportion of households in which both spouses
 say that they always talk to each other when there is disagreement, and
 a decrease in the proportion of households in which both spouses say that
 they never or rarely tell each other when there is disagreement.
 This increase in communication among spouses is confirmed using a Mann-Whitney
 U-test (p=0.001).
 The second treatment does not seem to affect the likelihood that spouses
 tell each other when they disagree (Mann-Whitney U-test p-value=0.1481).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Increased cooperation among spouses may render preferences of the individual
 members more aligned and lead to a more efficient allocation of resources.
 We test two strategies to increase cooperation between spouses.
 One directly targets the unequal distribution of knowledge related to recommend
ed practices and modern inputs.
 Information related to crop management, an important determinant of sustainable
 intensification, is generally provided to only one individual, under the
 assumption that information flows freely within the household.
 In a first treatment, we compare the impact on a range of outcomes between
 households where information was provided to the couple (husband and wife)
 and households where only one individual was given this same information.
 A second strategy targets gendered norms and customs, as in traditional
 societies, these may prevent the efficient allocation of resources within
 households.
 In a second treatment, we compare the impact on a range of outcomes between
 households that were shown an aspirational video of a couple farming together
 and households that were shown a video in which a man is responsible for
 productive activities.
 We do this using a field experiment involving 3,300 maize growing households
 in eastern Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by looking at decision making and confirm findings form 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doss2014owns"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who find that many of the decisions in agriculture in Uganda are already
 taken jointly.
 Still, in most cases the man is still the predominant decision maker, especiall
y if monetary outlays are involved, such as the decision to use fertilizer
 or improved seed.
 Reducing information asymmetry significantly increases joint decision making
 related to the decision to plant maize on the plot, on strategies to fight
 striga, and on the timing of the first weeding.
 There is also some evidence that reducing information asymmetry increases
 joint decision making related to the use of fertilizer.
 No effects are found from projecting a cooperative approach to farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we look at labor time allocations of husband and wife with respect
 to maize farming.
 We find that the gap between woman labor and man labor reduces after reducing
 information asymmetry.
 While we find suggestive evidence that the husband works more on land preparati
on and harvesting, the effects are driven by a decrease in the labor supply
 of the wife.
 Also here, we find no impact of promoting a household cooperative approach.
 We further find that households where information was distributed among
 both spouses are more likely to indicate the intention to invest in agriculture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As increased cooperation was expected to increase overall efficiency, we
 also look at household level outcomes.
 In particular, we test if household level knowledge about recommended practices
 and modern inputs is affected differently by the two treatments.
 We also look at differences in adoption of a range of practices and inputs.
 A third family of household level outcomes we consider is related to production.
 Finally, we test if our interventions have impacted household level welfare.
 We do not find any impact of our interventions on any of these household
 level outcomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we explore some of the impact pathways through which we expected
 our interventions to work.
 For instance, we assume that our interventions would facilitate monitoring,
 which we would expect to reduce disagreement between spouse's answers.
 We do not generally find this to be the case.
 Finally, we expect that spouses communicate more if they are encouraged
 to cooperate.
 Here, we do find that households where information asymmetry was reduced
 are more likely to tell each other when they do not agree about a particular
 maize related issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, we conclude that despite some evidence of increased joint decision
 making, we find little impact of our interventions at the household level.
 The null results we obtain from the second intervention across the board
 in particular are at odds with findings in other studies on role model
 effects.
 Most likely, this is due to the fact that the exposure to the role models
 was not intensive enough: while the videos were engaging, they were only
 about 10 minutes long.
 Other studies use movies of over one hour, or repeated exposure to role
 models.
 In addition, there are some indications that the farmers that were enrolled
 in the study had difficulty identifying with the actors, as most perceived
 them to be quite different from themselves.
 Furthermore, the fact that we do not find effects does not mean that efforts
 to increase cooperation are futile.
 There may be impact in the future given that we find a significant increase
 in joint investment in agriculture.
 The only impact at the household level of reducing information asymmetry
 is an increase in organic fertilizer use, which contributes to long run
 soil health.

Note: Column 1 reports differences between video only and video+ivr (and
 standard error) with its corresponding p-value in column 2; column 3 reports
 differences between video+ivr and video+ivr+SMS (and standard error) with
 its corresponding p-value in column 4; sample size is reported in column
 5.
 Reported p-values are based on randomization inference (10,000 permutations);
 ***, ** and * denote that the difference is signficant at the 1, 5 and
 10 percent level, respectively, after correcting for multiple hypothesis
 testing using a family-wise sharp null (10,000 permutations).
 All specifications control for the other orthogonal factors in the factorial
 design.
 Additional controls for the IVR treatment are  age of household head at
 baseline, household size at baseline and number of bedrooms at baseline.
 Additional controls for the SMS treatment are  number of bedrooms at baseline.
