Increasing cooperation in agricultural households: Experimental evidence
 from maize farming households in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Smallholder agriculture households are composed of different individuals,
 each with their own preferences and access to resources, operating in a
 context governed by particular norms and beliefs.
 This realization resulted in many interventions aimed at strengthening
 the bargaining position of women within the household.
 At the same time, the household is also the predominant unit of production
 in which cooperation, specialization and investment in common goods may
 lead better outcomes.
 Instead of pitching spouses against each other, test two interventions
 designed to increase spousal cooperation.
 The first targets cognitive channels and estimates the impact of reducing
 differences in the information available to each spouse.
 The second targets non-cognitive skills, encouraging household members
 to approach maize farming as a household business, thereby challenging
 social norms and gender stereotypes that men and women should engage in
 different activities.
 We find that reducing intra-household information asymmetries increases
 joint decision making, reduces the labor time gap between spouses, increases
 the intention to jointly invest in agriculture, and increases communication
 among spouses.
 We find no effects on household level production outcomes.
 We find no effect of promoting a household cooperative approach to maize
 farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In semi-subsistence agriculture, the prevailing unit of production is the
 agricultural household.
 However, these households consist of different household members, each
 with their own utility functions and access to resources.
 The preferences of the different household members may not perfectly align,
 and there may be considerable inequality in access to resources
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579183971

 & Kanbur, R.
 (1995).
 Unitary versus collective models of the household: Is it time to shift
 the burden of proof? World Bank Research Observer, 10, 1-19.) 
\change_unchanged
.
 Research shows that this often results in inefficient allocation of production
 factors within these households.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "udry1996gender"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 finds significant differences in productivity between male-managed and
 female-managed plots due to the fact that more fertilizer and labor is
 allocated to man managed plots.
 Given diminishing returns to especially fertilizer use, he finds that reallocat
ing production factors from man managed to women managed plots may increase
 household level productivity by 6 percent.
 The realization that household members compete as well as cooperate has
 led to a burgeoning literature grounded in collective bargain theory, with
 the important policy implication being that interventions may have different
 impact depending on who is targeted within the household 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "New1,haddad1997intrahousehold"

\end_inset

.
 Many interventions started to target women within households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, the focus has shifted somewhat, focusing less on intra-household
 competition and more on cooperation between household members.
 This is partly due to the fact that alternative models of the household
 have been proposed that provide more room for intra-household cooperation.
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579184024
Non-cooperative bargaining models acknowledge that households can persist
 in Pareto inefficient outcomes (Doss 2013).
 There is also ample (experimental) evidence that households do not always
 opt for cooperation and efficiency gains can be made (Munro 2018; Iversen
 et al.
 2011; Fiala and He 2016).

\change_unchanged
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doss2015collective"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 point out that households face collective action problems similar to those
 studied in the context of common pool resources management.
 Furthermore, many resources are jointly owned and decisions jointly made,
 and so the clear division between man managed and women managed plots underlyin
g bargaining models may be the exception rather that the rule

\end_inset

.
 For some time now, the literature on measuring women empowerment has been
 stressing that unilateral decisions made by a women within the household
 should not always be strictly preferred to instances where decisions are
 taken together

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we test two different strategies to improve 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579184070
various outcomes though increasing
\change_unchanged
 intra-household cooperation among a sample of smallholder maize farmers
 in Uganda.
 Each strategy targets a different impact pathway.
 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579184091
We examine a number of outcomes that proxy the level of cooperation.
 These include joint decision-making about strategic agricultural decisions
 under the assumption that maximizing the joint household utility function
 is more likely if both spouses participate in decision making (McPeak and
 Doss 2006).
 A related outcome is the extent to which spouses can express disagreement
 about decisions related to agriculture.
 Another outcome is the gap between labor time contributed by the wife and
 labor time contributed by the husband whereby we assume that unbalanced
 contributions of time can hamper productivity by the overburdened spouse
 and therefore the total agricultural production of the household ( Diksha
 Arora & Codrina Rada (2017) A Gendered Model of the Peasant Household:
 Time poverty and Farm Production in Rural Mozambique, Feminist Economics,
 23:2, 93-119, DOI: 10.1080/13545701.2016.1220676 ).
 With cooperation, the efficiency of household farming is assumed to be
 maximized.
 We therefore also look at outcomes such the likelihood that both spouses
 prioritize investment in agriculture and household level production outcomes.
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first strategy involves reducing information asymmetries within households.
 Informational frictions are important barriers to agricultural technology
 adoption and sustainable intensification 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "magruder2018assessment"

\end_inset

.
 Access to information and ensuing knowledge may be unequally distributed
 between spouses within the household, which may reduce the likelihood that
 spouses cooperate in an effective way

 it is not all that obvious that unequal distribution of info/knowledge
 would encumber cooperation (understood as Pareto efficiency)

.
 We test the effectiveness of reducing information gaps between spouses
 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579184166
for more cooperative outcomes 
\change_unchanged
by comparing outcomes in households in which information was made available
 to only one of the spouses—the husband or wife—to outcomes in households
 in which this information was made available to both spouses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second strategy consists of promoting a mental image of farming as a
 joint venture, with both spouses having an equal role in decision making,
 activities, and rewards.
 Farming happens in a particular cultural context, and social norms may
 hamper efficient allocation of production factors.
 For instance, in patrilineal societies it may be that only men are assumed
 to make decisions on certain crops, or only women are allowed to carry
 out certain activities.
 However, norms and customs can change, and role models have been found
 to be important catalysts 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "porter2019gender"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 We therefore devise an intervention aimed at promoting a cooperative approach
 to farming by the household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Central to both treatments are short, engaging videos that were produced
 with a dual purpose.
 First, the videos are designed to provide information on a range of yield
 increasing agricultural management practices such as timely planting, seed
 spacing and seed rate, and strategies to deal with striga, a parasitic
 weed that is a major threat to maize in the area.
 The videos also recommend the use of modern inputs such as fertilizer and
 improved seed.
 Second, the videos are designed to change a range of non-cognitive personality
 traits, such as aspirations, locus-of-control, and attitudes to change,
 of the persons that view the video.
 In particular, the videos bring the story of a farmer that used to struggle
 with low maize yields and
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579184192
, after a particularly bad year,
\change_unchanged
 decides things need to change.
 It is then shown how the farmer uses recommended practices and improved
 inputs.
 It is explained that becoming a successful farmer takes time, and money
 needs to be invested 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579184207
now
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579184207
incrementally
\change_unchanged
 to get better results in the future.
 The video ends with the image of a successful farmer assuring the viewer
 that he or she can also become successful by following the advice provided
 in the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the first intervention–reducing intra-household information
 asymmetries–increases joint decision making on a range of agronomic practices.
 We also find that there is an increase in the likelihood that spouses jointly
 decide to use fertilizer.
 The intervention also reduces the gap between labor time contributed by
 the wife and labor time contributed by the husband.
 Furthermore, reducing intra-household information asymmetries increases
 the likelihood that both spouses prioritize investment in agriculture.
 There is also evidence that spouses are more likely to tell each other
 if they disagree about something related to agriculture when information
 asymmetry is reduced.
 We find no effects on household level production outcomes.
 The second intervention–projecting a cooperative approach to maize farming–also
 does not appear to have much impact.
 This may be because farmers are unable to identify with the role models
 in the video.
 It may also be that the treatment is too light to have an impact through
 non-cognitive pathways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The next section presents
 the research questions, the interventions we use to test the research hypothese
s, and the underlying theory of change.
 We then present the experimental design and test pre-treatment balance
 between the different treatment groups on a range of household characteristics.
 We then turn to the results, first looking at how the interventions affect
 joint decision making.
 We then test if increasing cooperation also leads to a more equitable distribut
ion of labor.

different
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579184337

 There are various reasons why this may be the case.
 It may be that when both spouses receive information, spouses discuss and
 reflect on this information, making it more likely that they also

Maybe this should be extended: Are these all the impact pathways we can
 think of? Should we tie this better in the literature.
 Most importantly, can we connect this to the analysis (eg the monitoring
 pathway can be approximated by spousals disagreement, increased communication
 may be proxied by the likelihood that they tell each other that they disagree,
 maybe we can also do something with knowledge to look at monopolization).
 Should this even be here or better in a separate section, as these impact
 pathways may also to a more or less extent be important for the second
 intervention? One thing we can do is remove the knowledge from the aggregate
 results and put a separate knowledge monopolization impact pathway part.

 activities.
 This may lead women to become more assertive when men take decisions or
 it may make men more open to women participation in farming.

 Other recommended practices include timely planting and weeding.
 Second, the information was packaged as an inspirational story of poor
 farmers that, over time, are able to break out of a poverty trap.
 The video starts with a farmer explaining that he used to struggle with
 low yields, producing barely enough food to feed his family, but that over
 the years, he learned how to increase the number of bags of maize produced
 on his maize plots.
 It is shown how the farmer starts using recommended practices on a small
 part of his land.
 It is also shown how he sells a chicken and borrows some money from a neighbor
 to buy improved seed and fertilizer.
 The return on this initial investment is then re-invested, and the viewer
 is taken through some basic inter-temporal cost-benefit calculations.
 The video ends by showing a happy farmer that assures the viewer that he
 or she can also become a successful farmer by following his example.

on which decisions are made (1) jointly, (2) by the husband alone, and (3)
 by the wife alone for seven key decisions.
 For (1), we classified the decision as having been taken jointly if both
 spouses agree that the decision was taken jointly.

We see that decision making patterns are similar across most management
 practices, but that men are more likely to make decisions related to input
 use.
 For decisions related to timing of planting, seeds spacing and seed rate,
 managing striga and timing of first weeding (barplots 2 to 5), shares of
 plots on which decisions are taken jointly are in line with the decision
 to plant maize on the plot in the first place (reported in the first barplot
 of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision-making"

\end_inset

).
 Furthermore, for these activities, the share of plots on which these decisions
 are taken by the man alone is very close to the share of plots on which
 these decisions are taken jointly, and range between 27 and 36 percent
 of the plots.
 The proportion of plots on which women say they make decisions on planting,
 timing, spacing, striga management, and weeding ranges from 13 to 18 percent.
 Overall, patterns are according to expectations, with women somewhat more
 important for decisions related to weeding and men more likely to decide
 on spacing

The decision to use fertilizer (barplot 6), and the decision to use improved
 seed especially (barplot 7), seems to be more likely to be made by the
 husband alone.
 For instance, on 41 percent of the plots where fertilizer was used, this
 decision was made by the man alone.

Figure

\end_inset

 summarizes the impact of the two interventions on joint decision making
 (again defined as the share of plots on which both spouses report that
 the decision to implement a particular practice or to use a certain input
 was made jointly).
 We consider the same set of decisions as in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision-making"

\end_inset

.
 We report point estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals for the differenc
e in the share of plots on which each of these 7 decisions were made jointly
 (expressed in standard deviations to facilitate comparisons within and
 across figures).
 In dark blue, we report differences in joint decision making between households
 where information was provided to both spouses (the treatment group), and
 joint decision making in households where information was given to only
 one of the spouses (either the husband or the wife; the comparison group).
 In light blue, we report differences in joint decision making between household
s where the information was provided by a couple (the treatment group) and
 joint decision making in households where information was given by a man
 (the comparison group).
 While we find no impact of the second treatment, reducing information asymmetry
 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579187160
with the first treatment 
\change_unchanged
significantly increases joint decision making related to the decision to
 plant maize on the plot, on strategies to fight striga, on the timing of
 the first weeding, and on the use of fertilizer.

The decision on when to start planting is taken jointly on 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579187480
an average

32 percent of the plots.
 This decision is made jointly on an additional 2 percent of plots (correspondin

 reduced
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579187513
 with the first treatment

, but the increase is not significant.
 The decision on spacing is also taken jointly on 32 percent of the plots.
 Also for this decision, the rate increases

 In particular, we ask the husband and wife separately how many man-days

 Households spent most time on weeding.

 Summing over all activities, women work about 40 days in maize farming,
 men work about 39 days.
 We do see some differences according to gender, with men spending on average
 one day more on land preparation than women, and women spending on average
 2 days more on weeding than men.

Following a traditional theory of change, the first outcome we consider
 is knowledge.
 We tested knowledge with four carefully chosen multiple choice questions
 that were asked to each spouse individually.
 One question tests technical knowledge about a new agronomic practice that
 was shown in the video, while another question asked about a practice that
 was assumed to be known by most farmers, but not universally practiced.
 A third question focused less on technical detail, but wanted to assess
 if farmers also absorbed the broader message in the video that successful
 farmers approach maize growing as a business, which involves planning,
 foresight, risk taking, and investment outlays.
 A final question was on a topic on which no information was provided in
 the video and was added to verify the effectiveness of the video

.
 Knowledge at the household level is assessed by the likelihood that at
 least one of the spouses is able to indicate the correct response on the
 multiple choice question.
 Using an index based on these four questions, we do not find that reducing
 information asymmetry 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579191135
between spouses (first treatment) 
\change_unchanged
significantly increased knowledge at the household level.
 We also find no effect of the second treatment on household level knowledge.

This null result may indicate that the information treatment was not effective
 in changing the knowledge we measure using the index and/or that information
 is shared efficiently within the household.
 We find support for both explanations.
 On the one hand, looking into the different components of the index, we
 find that reducing information asymmetry does increase the likelihood that
 both spouses know the recommended spacing and seed rate (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowledge"

\end_inset

, first row, column 2).
 As can be seen in column 1, average knowledge about this particular topic
 is very low: only in about 6 percent of households, both spouses were able
 to select the correct option on the multiple choice question.
 From this, we conclude that reducing information asymmetries may be effective
 for increasing household level knowledge if the information concerns new
 practices or technologies and the potential for learning is high.

Note that knowledge on what to do against fall armyworm is similarly low.
 But recall that here we did not expect to find an impact as the intervention

 On the other hand, if we split the comparison group into two according
 to gender, we find that the difference becomes insignificant if we compare
 knowledge of households where couples were treated to households where
 men alone were treated (column 4), but remains significant between households
 where couples were treated and households where only women were treated
 (column 6).
 Consistent with the existence of information spillovers within the household,
 we find that in households where the husband alone was shown the video,
 81 percent say they discussed the video with their wife.
 Among households where only the wife was shown the video, only 71 percent
 say they discussed the video with their husband (and this difference is
 significant at p<0.001 using Fisher's exact test).
 In other words, information seems to be shared less if targeted to the
 wife only.
 We do not find that projecting a household approach affected knowledge
 at the household level.
 Also when looking at the components of the index individually (column 7

The second outcome family collects outcomes related to the adoption of the
 improved agronomic practices that were recommended in the video (see also
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

).
 Here, we construct an index from 4 practices; details can be found in Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:practices"

\end_inset

.
 The first practice is timely planting.
 Maize should be planted at the onset of the rains.
 We have asked each spouse how many days after the start of the rains the
 maize was planted on each maize plot.
 To arrive at a 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579191190
household level 
\change_unchanged
measure 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579191193
at the household level
\change_unchanged
, we first take the average of the responses of the spouses at plot level,
 and then take averages over plots.
 Using this measure, we find that maize on the average plot is planted about
 4 days after the onset of the rains.
 The next three practices–the use of the recommended seeds spacing and seed
 rate, the recommended way to fight striga, and optimal timing of first
 weeding–are all assessed using simple yes/no questions asked to each spouse
 individually for each plot.
 To aggregate these outcomes at the household level, we take a generous
 approach and construct a household level indicator that takes the value
 of one if at least one spouse reports that the practice was adopted on
 at least one plot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do not find a significant difference in the adoption of recommended practices
 between households where both spouses are shown the video together and
 households where only one of the spouses was shown the video
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579191274
 (first treatment)
\change_unchanged
.
 Looking at Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:practices"

\end_inset

, we see that reducing information asymmetries 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579191287
also
\change_unchanged
 reduced average time between the first rain and planting by almost one
 day, but the effect is not significant.
 We also find that adoption of the new way of spacing and planting maize
 is adopted by 3.2 percentage points more households that were shown the
 video as a couple as compared to within households where only one of the
 spouses was shown the video, but also here the difference is not significant.
 There are 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579191307

\begin_layout Standard
Third
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579191411

 we look the use of modern inputs: fertilizer and improved maize seed.
 For fertilizer, the index in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 summarizes the use of three types: DAP/NPK
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579191537
 (Diammonium phosphate/Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium)
\change_unchanged
, urea, and organic fertilizer.
 We again define input use at the household level generously: for each type
 of fertilizer, an indicator is calculated that is true if at least one
 spouse indicated that the particular type of fertilizer was used on at
 least one of the maize plots.
 We find that, according to the index, reducing information asymmetries
 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579191582
(first treatment) 
\change_unchanged
increases fertilizer use, although the effect is only significant at a 10
 percent significance level.
 Analysis of the use of different 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579191654

\change_unchanged
types, reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, show that the impact is driven by an increase in the likelihood that household
s use organic fertilizer.
 For seed use, the index aggregates hybrid seed and Open Pollinated Varieties.
 We do not find that improved seed use changed significantly after reducing
 intra-household information asymmetry
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579191674

to household farming (second treatment) 
\change_unchanged

 The use of hybrid seed seems to be somewhat higher among households that
 saw a video featuring a couple role model.
 However, the difference is not statistically significant after controlling
 Family Wise Error rates.

\begin_layout Standard
We then look at production related outcomes.
 The index summarized in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HH_impact_info_asym"

\end_inset

 was calculated from household level production, area (included in the index
 as a negative outcome since we are interested in intensification where
 more is produced on less land), and a subjective assessment of productivity.
 Household level production was estimated by taking the average between
 plot level production reported by man and woman, and them summing production
 over all plots within the household.
 Following our pre-analysis plan, we then take logarithms and trim at 5
 percent.
 Similarly, for area, we take averages of plot level area estimates between
 spouses, sum to obtain household level estimates, and use trimmed logarithms.
 The subjective question takes the form of a binary variable that takes
 the value of one if any spouse reports better yield 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579191819
than normal 
\change_unchanged
on any plot

Spouses may disagree about certain maize production activities.
 We ask each spouse separately whether, in case of disagreement about any

 Respondents were allowed to indicate the likeliness that they would tell

 Overall, we find that in almost 32 percent of households, both spouses

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Increased cooperation among spouses may render preferences of the individual
 members more aligned and lead to a more efficient allocation of resources.
 We test two strategies to increase cooperation between spouses.
 One directly targets the 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579193668
unequal distribution
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579193672

\change_deleted 1966826031 1579193266
knowledge

information
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579193680
 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579193682
 between spouses 
\change_unchanged
related to recommended practices and modern inputs
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579193286
 for agricultural production
\change_unchanged
.
 Information related to crop management, an important determinant of sustainable
 intensification, is generally provided to only one individual, under the
 assumption that information flows freely within the household.
 In a first treatment, we 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579193771
compare
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579193772
assess
\change_unchanged
 the impact on a range of outcomes 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579193337
between
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579193353
of providing
\change_unchanged
 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579193363
households where
\change_unchanged
 information 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579193367
was provided 
\change_unchanged
to the couple (husband and wife
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579193372
 together
\change_unchanged
) 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579193381
and
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579193403
versus providing this same information to
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579193392

was given this same information
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579193411

\change_unchanged
.
 A second strategy targets gendered norms and customs, as in

 taken jointly.
 Still, in most cases the man is still the predominant decision maker, especiall

 or improved seed.
 Reducing information asymmetry
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579193698
 between spouses
\change_unchanged
 significantly increases joint decision making related to the decision to
 plant maize on the plot, on strategies to fight striga, and on the timing

 There is also some evidence that reducing information asymmetry increases

\change_inserted 1966826031 1579193877

\change_inserted 1966826031 1579193946
agricultural production related 
\change_unchanged

 In particular, we test if household level knowledge about recommended practices

\change_deleted 1966826031 1579193910
differently
\change_unchanged
 by the two treatments.
 We also look at differences in adoption of a range of practices and inputs.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we explore some of the impact pathways through which we expected

interventions
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579194003

\change_unchanged
 to work.
 For instance, we assume that our

interventions
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579194013

 We do not 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579194035
generally
\change_unchanged
 find this to be the case.
 Finally, we expect that spouses communicate more if they are encouraged
 to cooperate.
 Here, we do find that households where information asymmetry was reduced
 are more likely to tell each other when they do not agree
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579194057

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, we conclude that 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1579194653
despite some evidence of increased joint decision making, we find little
 impact of our interventions at the household level
\change_inserted 1966826031 1579195153
the first treatment which aimed to reduce information assymmetry between
 spouses about good agronomic practices for maize production was succesful
 in increasing cooperation between spouses in some regards.
 Joint decision making about strategic agricultural decisions was increased,
 which may increase the likelihood that the joint household utility function
 will be maximized (McPeak and Doss 2006).
 Spouses also became also more likely to express any disagreement about
 decisions related to maize production.
 The labor allocations by wife and husband became somewhat more balanced,
 particularly through a reduction in labor time by women, who tend to be
 the ones with the heaviest work burden.
