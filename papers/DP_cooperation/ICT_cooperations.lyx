Increasing cooperation in agricultural households: Experimental evidence
 from maize farming households in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Even though the household is often considered as the primary unit of production
 in smallholder agriculture, household members compete as well as cooperate.
 Rooted in the theory of non-cooperative bargaining models, development
 interventions and policies started explicitly targeting women.
 Recently, the focus has shifted somewhat, focusing less on intra-household
 competition and more on cooperation between household members.
 This paper documents patterns of cooperation between co-heads of monogamous
 maize growing households in eastern Uganda.
 Furthermore, inspired by recent research on the power of role models in
 behavioral change communication, we test if cooperation can be promoted
 by a short video that shows spouses cooperating on the maize farm.
 We find that spouses cooperate well: most decisions are taken together
 and the labour burden is shared equally.
 We do not find that the role model intervention increases cooperation.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In subsistence agriculture, the prevailing unit of production is the agricultura
l household.
 However, these households consist of different household members, each
 with their own utility functions and access to resources.
 The preferences of the different household members may not perfectly align,
 and there may be considerable inequality in access to resources.
 Research shows that this often results in inefficient allocation of production
 factors within these households.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "udry1996gender"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 finds significant differences in productivity between man managed and women
 managed plots due to the fact that more fertilizer and labor is allocated
 to man managed plots.
 Given diminishing returns to especially fertilizer use, he finds that reallocat
ing production factors from man managed to women managed plots may increase
 household level productivity by 6 percent.
 The realization that household members compete as well as cooperate has
 led to a burgeoning literature grounded in collective bargain theory, with
 the important policy implication being that interventions may have different
 impact depending on who is targeted within the household

.
 Many interventions started to target women within households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, the focus has shifted somewhat, focusing less on intra-household
 competition and more on cooperation between household members.
 This is partly due to the fact that alternative models of the household
 have been proposed that provide more room for intra-household cooperation.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doss2015collective"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 point out that households face collective action problems similar to those
 studied in the context of common pool resources management.
 Furthermore, many resources are jointly owned and decisions jointly made,
 and so the clear division between man managed and women managed plots underlyin
g bargaining models may be the exception rather that the rule

key "doss2014owns,twyman2015gendered,doi:10.1111/dpr.12243"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 For some time now, the literature on measuring women empowerment has been
 stressing that unilateral decisions made by a women within the household
 should not always be strictly preferred to instances where decisions are
 taken together 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "alkire2013women"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we use detailed data from both male and female co-heads of
 monogamous semi-subsistence farm households in eastern Uganda to document
 patterns of cooperation in maize farming.
 In particular, at the plot level, we look at how decisions are made on
 a series of important agronomic practices.
 We also look at who provides labour for different agronomic activities
 such as land preparation, planting, weeding and harvesting.
 We also collected some information on how spouses deal with agricultural
 related disagreement.
 Finally, we look at maize sales and looks at patterns of income hiding
 between spouses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paper also tests a light touch intervention aimed at increasing cooperation
 between spouses.
 Inspired be recent research on behavioral change communication and social
 marketing, we promote a mental image of farming as a joint venture, with
 both spouses having an equal role in decision making, activities, and rewards.
 Farming happens in a particular cultural context, and social norms may
 hamper efficient allocation of production factors.
 For instance, in patrilineal societies it may be that only men are assumed
 to make decisions on certain crops, or only women are allowed to carry
 out certain activities.
 However, norms and customs can change, and role models have been found
 to be important catalysts 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "porter2019gender"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 We therefore devise an intervention aimed at promoting a cooperative approach
 to farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper we contribute to a growing literature that provides insight
 into intra-household processes by collecting data from multiple household
 members.
 Studies that collect data from male and female co-heads separately find
 that spouses often provide different answers when asked about asset ownership,
 income or decision making

\end_inset

.
 For a range of key outcomes, we ask each co-head about his or her own decision
 making, activities and income, but also elicit views on decision making,
 activities and income of the spouse.
 This allows us to differentiate between spousal disagreement arising from
 information asymmetries as identified in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and intentional hiding of effort, assets or income.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The videos are designed to provide information on a range of yield increasing
 agricultural management practices such as timely planting, seed spacing
 and seed rate, and strategies to deal with striga, a parasitic weed that
 is a major threat to maize in the area.
 The videos also recommend the use of modern inputs such as fertilizer and
 improved seed.
 Second, the videos are designed to change a range of non-cognitive personality
 traits, such as aspirations, locus-of-control, and attitudes to change,
 of the persons that view the video.
 In particular, the videos bring the story of a farmer that used to struggle
 with low maize yields and, after a particularly bad year, decides things
 need to change.
 It is then shown how the farmer uses recommended practices and improved
 inputs.
 It is explained that becoming a successful farmer takes time, and money
 needs to be invested now to get better results in the future.
 The video ends with the image of a successful farmer assuring the viewer
 that he or she can also become successful by following the advice provided
 in the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We find that the first intervention–reducing intra-household information
 asymmetries–increases joint decision making on a range of agronomic practices.
 We also find that there is an increase in the likelihood that spouses jointly
 decide to use fertilizer.
 The intervention also reduces the gap between labor time contributed by
 the wife and labor time contributed by the husband.
 Furthermore, reducing intra-household information asymmetries increases
 the likelihood that both spouses prioritize investment in agriculture.
 There is also evidence that spouses are more likely to tell each other
 if they disagree about something related to agriculture when information
 asymmetry is reduced.
 We find no effects on household level production outcomes.
 The second intervention–projecting a cooperative approach to maize farming–also
 does not appear to have much impact.
 This may be because farmers are unable to identify with the role models
 in the video.
 It may also be that the treatment is too light to have an impact through
 non-cognitive pathways.

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The next section presents
 the research questions, the interventions we use to test the research hypothese
s, and the underlying theory of change.
 We then present the experimental design and test pre-treatment balance
 between the different treatment groups on a range of household characteristics.
 We then turn to the results, first looking at how the interventions affect
 joint decision making.
 We then test if increasing cooperation also leads to a more equitable distribut
ion of labor.
 As changes in aspirations have been found to affect forward looking behavior
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, we also look at the impact of the interventions on intentions to invest
 proceeds from maize farming.
 We then explore household level outcomes.
 A next section explores spousal disagreement and we also report effects
 on the likelihood that farmers tell each other in the event of disagreement.
 A final section concludes.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a second hypothesis, we will therefore test whether projecting a household
 cooperative approach to farming leads to better outcomes.
 Also here, we posit different impact pathways.
 First, there may be aspirational effects of seeing a couple farming maize
 successfully together.
 The intervention may also serve to challenge social norms and gender roles
 that prescribe that men specialize in productive and women in reproductive
 activities.
 This may lead women to become more assertive when men take decisions or
 it may make men more open to women participation in farming.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Also here, can we look more into mechanisms? Unfortunately, we threw out
 all questions that attempted to measure aspirations, but maybe we can argue
 that the decision to invest in agriculture is indicative of an aspirational
 effect?

\begin_layout Section
Study context, Interventions and Experimental design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study involved a among a random sample of maize farmers in southwestern
 Uganda.
 Two-stage cluster sampling was used to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, from five districts (Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo,
 and Namutumba), we first selected 50 parishes randomly and in proportion
 to the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all the households, from which we sampled
 10 households to be included in the study.
 This resulted in a total sample size of 3,280 households.
 However, to investigate cooperation within the household, we only use household
s where we managed to interview both spouses separately, which was the case
 in 2,548 households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intervention was only implemented on a subset of the data.
 In 261 households, a video was shown where a couple is depicted, while
 in 475 households, a video was shown where the recommended practices were
 illustrated by a man or a woman alone.

 reports orthogonality tests for experiments.
 The first column reports sample means (and standard deviations in parentheses
 below) for the variables indicated to the left, measured at baseline (baseline
 data was collected in August 2017).
 For instance, we found that at the time of baseline data collection, average
 yields in the sample amounted to about 264 kg per acre
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is a very low yield; during focus group discussions, we learned that
 yields are normally about 500 to 700 kg per acre.
 The low yield is most likely a result of adverse weather shocks and the
 fall armyworm outbreak during the first season of 2017.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Average age of the household head in our sample is 40 years and only about
 36 percent reported to have finished primary education.
 The average household has more than 7 members who live in a house with
 2.2 bedrooms.
 Only 11 percent had access to agricultural extension in the preceding year,
 about 20 percent used (inorganic) fertilizer and almost 40 percent reported
 to have used improved seed.
 Average distance to the nearest agro-input dealer is 5.5 km and almost 80
 percent of households own a mobile phone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second column, we report differences in means at baseline between
 households that received the extension information as a couple and households
 where only one of the spouses (either the husband of the wife) received
 the information.
 We find significant imbalance on various baseline characteristics for this
 first treatment.
 For instance, we see that in the sub-sample of households that were given
 the information as a couple, the household head is almost 4 years older
 than in households where the information was given to only one of the spouses.
 Household heads in households that were treated as a couple are also significan
tly more likely to have finished primary education.
 We further find that these households are about 10 percentage points more
 likely to own a mobile phone and 5 percentage points less likely to have
 used fertilizer.
 We also have some indications that access to extension and households size
 is correlated with the treatment.
 A test for joint orthogonality also indicates that there are significant
 differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups.
 The third column of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance_treat1"

\end_inset

 compares households where a video was shown featuring a couple role model
 to households that got to see a video in which a male maize farmer did
 all the acting.
 For this treatment, we find balance among almost all baseline characteristics.
 We also can not reject joint orthogonality.

Both experiments are implemented using short videos that were shown to farmers
 on tablet computers.
 The videos were designed with a dual purpose in mind.
 First, the videos serve to transfer knowledge about recommended agronomic
 management practices and the use of modern technologies.
 It is shown how fields need to be prepared using organic fertilizer.
 Proper seed spacing and seeding rates and it importance are explained.
 furthermore, it is shown in detail how inorganic fertilizer needs to be
 applied and in what quantities.
 Furthermore, attention is devoted to identifying striga, a parasitic weed
 that affects maize yields in the area.
 We also devote ample attention to the importance of seed quality and recommend
 using hybrid seed or Open Pollinated Varieties (OPV).
 Other recommended practices include timely planting and weeding.
 Second, the information was packaged as an inspirational story of poor
 farmers that, over time, are able to break out of a poverty trap.
 The video starts with a farmer explaining that he used to struggle with
 low yields, producing barely enough food to feed his family, but that over
 the years, he learned how to increase the number of bags of maize produced
 on his maize plots.
 It is shown how the farmer starts using recommended practices on a small
 part of his land.
 It is also shown how he sells a chicken and borrows some money from a neighbor
 to buy improved seed and fertilizer.
 The return on this initial investment is then re-invested, and the viewer
 is taken through some basic inter-temporal cost-benefit calculations.
 The video ends by showing a happy farmer that assures the viewer that he
 or she can also become a successful farmer by following his example.

To answer the first research question–whether reducing information asymmetry
 within households is effective–we compare outcomes of households in which
 the couple (husband and wife together) is shown a video to outcomes of
 households in which with only one co-head of the household (husband or
 wife) is shown the video.
 To answer the second research question–whether promoting a household cooperativ
e approach to farming is effective–we compare outcomes of households where
 an aspirational video was shown in which a man and woman participate as
 equals on the family farm and deliver the message as a couple to outcomes
 of households where where an aspirational video was shown featuring only
 a man.

We start by exploring patterns of decision making related to maize growing
 within the household.
 In particular, we asked each spouse to list all maize plots that the household
 was cultivating during the season preceding the survey, which was the second
 agricultural seasons of 2018.
 We then cycle through the different plots and repeat a series of questions
 for each plot.
 We ask, for a range of key decisions that need to be made and that are
 known to significantly affect maize yields, who made the decision.
 Respondents could answer that decisions were made by the person that was
 interviewed alone, that the decision was made by the spouse of the person
 interviewed alone, by the person interviewed and his or her spouse jointly,
 by someone else inside or outside the household,by the person interviewed
 together with someone else inside or outside the household, or by the spouse
 jointly with someone else inside or outside the household.
 Respondents could also indicate that they did not know who made the decision.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by looking at the responses given by the male co-heads within the
 household (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision-making"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The first decision we consider was simply who decided maize should be planted
 on the particular plot.
 A second decision is related to timing of planting.
 Timely planting of maize is very important for subsequent maize yields.
 Maize planting should start immediately after the first rains of the season,
 resulting in significant time pressure when large areas need to be planted.
 A third important decision that maize farmers have to make is related to
 the spacing of seed and seed rate.
 There is a wide range of seed methods used by farmers.
 Some simply broadcast the seeds.
 However, row planting leads to significantly higher yields as plants have
 optimal space to obtain sufficient sun and nutrients.
 Farmers also often plant more than one seed per hill, because they fear
 some seeds may not geminate.
 However, planting more than one seed hill may again increase competition
 for light and nutrients, leading to stunted growth.
 It is therefore recommended to use only one seed per hill and engage in
 gap filling when seeds do not germinate after one week.
 We also asked who made decisions related to weed control.
 One was related to a particularly destructive weed (striga), the other
 was related to the timing of the first weeding.

The figure shows that joint decision making is the norm: on about half of
 the plots, male co-heads report that decisions are taken jointly.
 On one out of three plots, decisions are made by the male co-head alone,
 without consulting his wife.
 Generally, for each decision, women co-heads take decisions alone on only
 1 out of 10 plots according to men.
 There is some indication that decisions related to seed spacing is more
 likely to be taken by the male co-head alone compared to other decision
 areas.

 show responses as provided by the female co-head.
 Also here, we see that women report that decisions are generally made jointly.
 There is some more variation in the percentages.
 For instance, women report that decisions related to seed spacing were
 made jointly on only 30 percent of the plots.
 We also see that co-heads tend to overestimate their own decision making
 and underestimate the likelihood that decisions are made unilateral by
 their spouse.
 For instance, while male co-heads indicated that they alone took the decision
 to plant maize on about 32 percent of the plots, women say that man unilaterall
y take the decision to plant maize on 27 percent of the plots.
 At the same time, female co-heads say they alone decided to plant maize
 on 16 percent of the plots.
 Men indicate that women decided to plant maize on only 11 percent of the
 plots.

 shows results for the experiment.
 It shows the impact of showing a video portraying a couple on joint decision
 making on each of the decision areas described above.
 We consider two measures of the outcome variable, once as reported by the
 male co-head and once as reported by the female co-head.
 For instance, the first column in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:decisions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that among household where a video was shown where one individual
 provided the information (the control group), men report that the decision
 to plant maize was taken jointly on 52 percent of the plots.
 The second column indicates that among households that were shown the video
 where a couple provided information, men report that the decision to plant
 maize was taken jointly on 56.4 percent, corresponding to an average treatment
 effect of 4.4 percentage points.
 However, the increase in joint decision making is not statistically different
 from zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the third column, we again report control group means, but now as reported
 by the female co-heads within the household.
 We see for example, and consistent with Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, women report decisions related to seed spacing are taken jointly on only
 32.4 percent of the plots.
 The fourth column again shows the impact of the couple video treatment.
 Also here, we do not find an impact on joint decision making.

We also collected detailed information on labour.
 On each maize plot, we ask each co-head how much time, expressed in labour
 days, he or she worked on a particular activity.
 We also ask each co-head how much time his or her spouse worked on the
 plot on that particular task.
 The activities we esquire about are land preparation, planting, weeding,
 spraying and harvesting.
 Weeding happens at three different times, but is aggregated into one measure
 for this analysis.

 We see that the male co-head spends about 8 days preparing the plot, 2
 days planting, 15 days weeding, one day of spraying and 2 days harvesting.
 The male co-head reports that his wife one day less in preparing the land
 and also half a day less in weeding and spraying.
 In total the male co-head reports that men thus work about 28 days, while
 women work about 26 days.

 on all activities except spraying.
 Women claim they work about 7 to 8 days on field preparation, while their

 Women also indicate that they spend 17 days on weeding, while men spend
 only 14 days on that activity.
 Men and women spend about the same time on planting and harvesting.

We also test if shirking is affected.
 We define male co-heads to be shirking if the time they report to be allocating
 on a particular activity is less than what the female co-head thinks the
 male co-head is working.
 Analogous, we define female co-heads to be shirking if the time they report
 to be working on something is less than what the male co-head believes
 the female co-head is contributing.

Shirking is highest among men for weeding.
 On 42 percent of the plots, men indicate that they have in fact worked
 less than what the female co-head believes.
 Shirking is in general higher among male co-heads.
 Only for land preparation, women seem to shirk more than men.
 Again, we do not find that the intervention affects shirking, except maybe
 for the case of spraying by male co-heads.

We see that decision making patterns are similar across most management
 practices, but that men are more likely to make decisions related to input
 use.
 For decisions related to timing of planting, seeds spacing and seed rate,
 managing striga and timing of first weeding (barplots 2 to 5), shares of
 plots on which decisions are taken jointly are in line with the decision
 to plant maize on the plot in the first place (reported in the first barplot
 of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision-making"

\end_inset

).
 Furthermore, for these activities, the share of plots on which these decisions
 are taken by the man alone is very close to the share of plots on which
 these decisions are taken jointly, and range between 27 and 36 percent
 of the plots.
 The proportion of plots on which women say they make decisions on planting,
 timing, spacing, striga management, and weeding ranges from 13 to 18 percent.
 Overall, patterns are according to expectations, with women somewhat more
 important for decisions related to weeding and men more likely to decide
 on spacing.
 Already, a sizable part of decisions are made jointly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decision to use fertilizer (barplot 6), and the decision to use improved
 seed especially (barplot 7), seems to be more likely to be made by the
 husband alone.
 For instance, on 41 percent of the plots where fertilizer was used, this
 decision was made by the man alone.
 The decision to use improved seed is made jointly on only 12 percent of
 the plots.
 This suggests that new technologies, especially if these need to be purchased
 on the market, remain the domain of the husband.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Impact_dec"

\end_inset

 summarizes the impact of the two interventions on joint decision making
 (again defined as the share of plots on which both spouses report that
 the decision to implement a particular practice or to use a certain input
 was made jointly).
 We consider the same set of decisions as in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Joint-decision-making"

\end_inset

.
 We report point estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals for the differenc
e in the share of plots on which each of these 7 decisions were made jointly
 (expressed in standard deviations to facilitate comparisons within and
 across figures).
 In dark blue, we report differences in joint decision making between households
 where information was provided to both spouses (the treatment group), and
 joint decision making in households where information was given to only
 one of the spouses (either the husband or the wife; the comparison group).
 In light blue, we report differences in joint decision making between household
s where the information was provided by a couple (the treatment group) and
 joint decision making in households where information was given by a man
 (the comparison group).
 While we find no impact of the second treatment, reducing information asymmetry
 significantly increases joint decision making related to the decision to
 plant maize on the plot, on strategies to fight striga, on the timing of
 the first weeding, and on the use of fertilizer.

Table

 provides more detail.
 In the first column, sample averages are shown (with standard deviations
 in brackets below).
 For instance, we see that overall, the decision to cultivate maize is taken
 jointly on 36 percent of the plots.
 In the second column, we see that this share is almost 10 percentage points
 higher in the subgroup of households where the video was shown to both
 spouses together than in the subgroup of households where the video was
 shown to only one of the spouses (either the husband of the wife).
 This difference is significantly different from zero at a p-value of 0.007
 (reported in column 3) as determined by randomization inference and remains
 significant at the 5 percent level after accounting for multiple hypothesis
 testing using a family-wise sharp null.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decision on when to start planting is taken jointly on 32 percent of
 the plots.
 This decision is made jointly on an additional 2 percent of plots (correspondin
g to a 6 percent increase) among household where information asymmetry was
 reduced, but the increase is not significant.
 The decision on spacing is also taken jointly on 32 percent of the plots.
 Also for this decision, the rate increases after the treatment, but not
 significantly.
 Next, we find that decisions related to strategies to fight striga are
 taken jointly on 27 percent of maize plots.
 This percentage is almost 7 percentage points higher (corresponding to
 an increase of 26 percent) among households where both spouses were shown
 a video than among households where only one spouse got the information.
 We also find that the decision on when to start weeding is taken jointly
 on a significantly higher share of plots after reducing information asymmetries
 between spouses.
 Results for the second intervention are shown in the fifth column of Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:decision_full"

\end_inset

, also assessed as the difference between treatment and control (with standard

 We find that, in general, promoting a cooperative approach also increases
 joint decision making, but differences are never statistically significant.

To account for multiple hypothesis testing, we also calculate an index based
 on the five different practices on which was decided jointly.
 In particular, we follow

 and construct an inverse covariance weighted index that ensures that outcomes
 that are highly correlated with each other receive less weight, while outcomes
 that are uncorrelated and thus represent new information receive more weight.
 Judged by this index, we confirm that reducing information gaps between
 spouses increases joint decision making about agronomic practices.
 There is no impact from the intervention that aims to promote a cooperative
 approach using role models.

 These are treated separately, as questions on who decided on input use
 were only asked in households that reported to use the input.
 For instance, we find that fertilizer was used in only 509 households in
 our sample.
 Among these households, the decision to use fertilizer was taken jointly
 on about 21 percent of the plots.
 For the first treatment, we see that this percentage is about 15 percentage
 points higher in the treatment group than in the control group.
 We do not find a significant effect for the second treatment.
 Furthermore, we find no effects from either treatment on the likelihood
 that the decision to use improved seed was made jointly.

Spousal disagreement

Many studies have found substantial disagreement about what men and women

\end_inset

.
 If spouses monitor each other better, we can expect that there is less
 disagreement about practices and inputs used on maize plots.
 As mentioned above, the ability of spouses to monitor each other may be
 one of the mechanisms through which our interventions affect outcomes.
 We thus look at a range of practices and inputs, and verify if spouses
 are more or less likely to agree on the fact that these practices or inputs
 were adopted on a particular plot depending on the treatment group.
 The results from comparisons between treatment and control for both treatments
 are summarized by an index of disagreement on recommended agronomic practices
 and modern inputs in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Disagreement"

\end_inset

.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:disagree_adopt"

\end_inset

 provides detailed information.
 From this table, we see that there is substantial variation in disagreement
 between the different activities and practices.
 For instance, on almost 60 percent of maize plots, spouses disagree about
 the timing of planting that was used on the plot.
 There is far less disagreement about plant spacing and seed density, partly
 because there are only a few common ways of planting maize: here spouses
 disagreed about planting method on only 8 percent of plots.
 Overall, we do not find that reducing information asymmetry reduces that
 likelihood that spouses report that different practices or technologies
 were used on a given plot.
 In fact, we find that in the sub-group of farmers where the video was shown
 to both spouses, the likelihood that one spouse says fertilizer was used
 and the other spouse says this was not the case, increases.
 This suggests that reducing information asymmetry did not lead spouses
 to better monitor each other.
 There are also no effects of projecting a household cooperative approach.

\begin_layout Standard
Even though the interventions did not seem to increase monitoring of agronomic
 practices, it may be that spouses are more focused on output, and as a
 result, may engage in closer monitoring of production.
 As mentioned in the previous section, we asked husband and wife separately
 to estimate how much maize was harvested on each maize plot.
 Similarly, we asked each spouse about the area on which this maize was
 planted.
 Both measures are then combined to calculate yields as estimated by the
 husband and the wife separately.
 We then define disagreement as the absolute difference between what was
 reported by the husband and by the wife.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:disagree_prod"

\end_inset

 shows that these differences are large.
 For instance, the difference in the estimates of area between spouses is
 more than half an acre (with the average household cultivating maize on
 1.2 acres).
 Average household level production in our sample is about 512 kg of maize,
 and the difference in the estimates of production between spouses is 287
 kg.
 This combines into an even larger difference for yields: almost 360 (while
 average yields are 530 kg per acre).
 We find no effect from reducing information asymmetry.
 For the second intervention, all outcomes do seem to go in the same direction,
 suggesting that projecting a household cooperative approach to farming
 reduces disagreement in production related outcomes, but not significantly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we look at disagreement with respect to labor time invested in agriculture.
 For instance, it may be that increasing cooperation may reduce the tendency
 to shirk by the spouses.
 Here, we exploit the fact that we did not only ask spouses about their
 own labor time on each of the activities in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Analysis-of-time"

\end_inset

; we also asked each spouse to provide an estimate of the time that the
 other spouse spent on each activity.
 We define disagreement about the husband's labor supply as the difference
 between what was reported by the husband himself and what the wife reported
 as her husband's contribution.
 Similarly, we define disagreement about the wife's labor supply as the
 time she reported working and what the husband thinks she worked.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Disagreement"

\end_inset

 suggests that reducing information asymmetry reduces disagreement about
 labor somewhat.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:disagree_labor"

\end_inset

 shows that this effect is mainly due a reduction in disagreement about
 women's labor, as the gap between what the women reported and what the
 man reports that he thinks this wife works reduces significantly.
 Most of this effect is due to the fact that women reduce labor and bring
 it more in line with man's estimate, consistent with the results reported
 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:time_use_full"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we also look at disagreement with respect to amounts of maize sold.
 Income hiding by one of the spouses has been documented in several contexts
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "castilla2013ignorance"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 We conjecture that encouraging cooperation may lead to a reduction in income
 hiding.
 We assess the impact on income hiding through four outcomes.
 The first outcome simply looks at disagreement about whether sales have
 happened or not.
 If one of the spouses says that (part of the) maize was sold but the other
 says this was not the case, this may be a sign of income hiding.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:disagree_sales"

\end_inset

 shows that in almost one third of the households, there is disagreement
 this.
 We also asked each of the spouses separately to estimate how much was sold
 by (1) him or her, (2) by his or her spouse, and (3) jointly.
 Using this, we calculate the difference between what the husband reported
 to have sold alone and what the wife estimated was sold by her husband
 alone.
 Similarly, we calculate the difference between what the wife reported to
 have sold alone and what the husband estimated was sold by his wife alone.
 For joint sales, we take the absolute value of the difference between what
 was reported by the husband and the wife.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows there is some degree of income hiding, but there does not seem to
 be an impact from our interventions.

 shows answers provided by the husbands in our sample.
 Man say that they unilaterally decided to plant maize on 28 percent of
 the plots.
 They further report that on less than 10 percent of the plots, his wife
 was the one who decided to plan maize.
 According to the husband, that largest share of plots is decided upon jointly.
 In the second panel, we shown the answers that the wives in our sample
 gave.
 According to them, the share of plots on which the husband decided unilaterally
 is somewhat smaller than what husbands report, and the share of plots on
 which they report that they made the decision to plant maize increases
 to about 17 percent.
 However, women also indicate that most plots are decided upon jointly.
 In the final panel, we report the share of plots on which husband and wife
 agree that the decision to plant maize was made by the husband, the wife,
 or jointly.
 We see there is substantial disagreement about individual decision making.
 Interestingly, there seems to be much more agreement about joint decision
 making, with the share coming close to what women report.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Increased cooperation among spouses may render preferences of the individual
 members more aligned and lead to a more efficient allocation of resources.
 We test two strategies to increase cooperation between spouses.
 One directly targets the unequal distribution of knowledge related to recommend
ed practices and modern inputs.
 Information related to crop management, an important determinant of sustainable
 intensification, is generally provided to only one individual, under the
 assumption that information flows freely within the household.
 In a first treatment, we compare the impact on a range of outcomes between
 households where information was provided to the couple (husband and wife)
 and households where only one individual was given this same information.
 A second strategy targets gendered norms and customs, as in traditional
 societies, these may prevent the efficient allocation of resources within
 households.
 In a second treatment, we compare the impact on a range of outcomes between
 households that were shown an aspirational video of a couple farming together
 and households that were shown a video in which a man is responsible for
 productive activities.
 We do this using a field experiment involving 3,300 maize growing households
 in eastern Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by looking at decision making and confirm findings form 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doss2014owns"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who find that many of the decisions in agriculture in Uganda are already
 taken jointly.
 Still, in most cases the man is still the predominant decision maker, especiall
y if monetary outlays are involved, such as the decision to use fertilizer
 or improved seed.
 Reducing information asymmetry significantly increases joint decision making
 related to the decision to plant maize on the plot, on strategies to fight
 striga, and on the timing of the first weeding.
 There is also some evidence that reducing information asymmetry increases
 joint decision making related to the use of fertilizer.
 No effects are found from projecting a cooperative approach to farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we look at labor time allocations of husband and wife with respect
 to maize farming.
 We find that the gap between woman labor and man labor reduces after reducing
 information asymmetry.
 While we find suggestive evidence that the husband works more on land preparati
on and harvesting, the effects are driven by a decrease in the labor supply
 of the wife.
 Also here, we find no impact of promoting a household cooperative approach.
 We further find that households where information was distributed among
 both spouses are more likely to indicate the intention to invest in agriculture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As increased cooperation was expected to increase overall efficiency, we
 also look at household level outcomes.
 In particular, we test if household level knowledge about recommended practices
 and modern inputs is affected differently by the two treatments.
 We also look at differences in adoption of a range of practices and inputs.
 A third family of household level outcomes we consider is related to production.
 Finally, we test if our interventions have impacted household level welfare.
 We do not find any impact of our interventions on any of these household
 level outcomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we explore some of the impact pathways through which we expected
 our interventions to work.
 For instance, we assume that our interventions would facilitate monitoring,
 which we would expect to reduce disagreement between spouse's answers.
 We do not generally find this to be the case.
 Finally, we expect that spouses communicate more if they are encouraged
 to cooperate.
 Here, we do find that households where information asymmetry was reduced
 are more likely to tell each other when they do not agree about a particular
 maize related issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, we conclude that despite some evidence of increased joint decision
 making, we find little impact of our interventions at the household level.
 The null results we obtain from the second intervention across the board
 in particular are at odds with findings in other studies on role model
 effects.
 Most likely, this is due to the fact that the exposure to the role models
 was not intensive enough: while the videos were engaging, they were only
 about 10 minutes long.
 Other studies use movies of over one hour, or repeated exposure to role
 models.
 In addition, there are some indications that the farmers that were enrolled
 in the study had difficulty identifying with the actors, as most perceived
 them to be quite different from themselves.
 Furthermore, the fact that we do not find effects does not mean that efforts
 to increase cooperation are futile.
 There may be impact in the future given that we find a significant increase
 in joint investment in agriculture.
 The only impact at the household level of reducing information asymmetry
 is an increase in organic fertilizer use, which contributes to long run
 soil health.
