\begin_layout Abstract
Agricultural advisory services are generally biased towards men, with informatio
n targeted mainly to male members within the household, and in formats that
 often reinforce male dominance in agricultural decision making.
 We conduct a

\change_unchanged
 field experiment among maize-farming households in eastern Uganda, where,
 in the context of a video-mediated agricultural extension information campaign,
 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609774677
with a first treatment showing the video to the female co-head, either alone
 or as part of the couple, instead of to the male co-head alone, 
\change_unchanged
we

There are many well-established benefits to empowering women farmers in
 agriculture.
 A more prominent role for women in the farm household has been shown to
 result in a more efficient allocation of scarce resources within the household,
 a more equitable distribution of the returns to investments in household
 production, and general improvements in welfare and reductions in poverty

Women are likely to benefit from more inclusive agricultural extension models,
 as they face information deficiencies and asymmetries relative to men in
 a range of circumstances.
 In agriculture, women farmers have been shown to be more deprived of informatio
n regarding good agronomic practices

 This unequal access may contribute to lower adoption rates of improved
 agricultural practices and technologies among women.
 For example, studies show that with equal access to extension services,
 land, and labor, men and women farmers in male-headed households in Ghana
 would be as likely to adopt modern agronomic practices

\begin_layout Standard
Women’s access to information—specifically, to information provided by agricultu
ral extension services—may be subject to both extra-household and intra-househol
d constraints.
 The extra-household constraints can be infrastructural and logistic, such
 as for instance women not being targeted, women lacking the money to travel
 to extension training locations, or women lacking the time to attend because
 of household management, domestic and reproductive responsibilities 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "FLETSCHNER20111422,wodon2006gender"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Extra-household constraints may also exist in terms of information content
 or delivery: it may not be adapted to women’s interests or needs, or may
 not recognize women’s role as agricultural producers, and therefore may
 not appeal to women.
 Human capital constraints may also play a role given women’s generally
 lower levels of education in many rural contexts in developing countries.
 Norms limiting women’s mobility and women’s interaction with men may impose
 additional constraints.
 These extra-household constraints to women’s access to information mean
 that, in many situations, women may rely more on informal networks for
 gathering information.
 When these networks are gender-specific and gender-segregated, problems
 associated with asymmetric information persist

A (married) woman’s interaction with her husband may often be her main (intra-ho
usehold) source of information on agriculture.
 The assumption that information flows freely and frictionless within the
 household is implicit in most extension strategies that target the male
 household head 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Yet the assumption requires that preferences of male and female co-heads
 within a household align; that household resources, including information,
 are shared; and that households cooperate to reach Pareto-optimal outcomes.
 However, the conceptualization of the agricultural household as a unit
 with such properties has been challenged in theoretical work

In this paper, we examine how the design of information and communication
 technology (ICT) applications used in agricultural extension information
 campaigns affects household member's access—the female co-head 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609748170
within the household 
\change_unchanged
in particular—to informational resources, their agency, and their achievements
 in smallholder semi-subsistence farming.
 We conduct a field experiment among 3,330 maize-farming households in eastern
 Uganda and zoom in on two design features.
 In a first

treatment
\change_unchanged
, we focus on targeting of the information, and compare outcomes of households
 where the informational video was shown to the male co-head only (corresponding
 to the status quo in generic agricultural extension models), to outcomes
 in households where the female co-head was also exposed to the video—either
 alone or as part of 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1609747675

 In a second treatment, we investigate the potential of role models to increase
 participation in maize farming, a traditionally male dominated activity

 Here, we vary 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1609747746
exposure to
\change_unchanged
 the gender of the actors in the videos, and compare outcomes within households
 that were shown a video with a male actor (again corresponding to the status
 quo
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609747965
 of male extension providers
\change_unchanged
 in generic agricultural extension models) to outcomes within households

\change_inserted 1966826031 1609748028
 of actors - who can function as a role model for female farmers
\change_unchanged
.
 The outcomes we use to assess impact of the treatments are individual level
 and joint outcomes (the female co-head's knowledge, decision making, adoption
 and production, the male co-head's knowledge, decision making, adoption
 and production, or joint knowledge, decision making, adoption and production)
 as reported by the female co-head.

 women's outcomes and reduced men's outcomes.

We conducted a field experiment in 2017 among smallholder maize-farming
 households in eastern Uganda.
 Participants in the experiment were drawn from monogamous maize-cultivating
 households residing in five districts where maize is particularly important,
 both as a staple and as a marketable crop.
 The experiment was conducted during the second maize-growing season, which
 runs from approximately August to January of the following year, and is
 characterized by a shorter period of rainfall than the first maize-growing
 season

 During this second season, the complete cycle from planting to harvest
 requires three to three and a half months, and farmers tend to cultivate
 early-maturing but lower yielding maize varieties.
 Fields are prepared in August, planted in September, and harvested from
 December onward.

 than female-managed plots in Uganda.
 They link the productivity gap between male- and female-managed plots (controll
ed for plot size but without distinguishing between type of crops) to an
 unequal distribution between men and women of responsibilities and resources,
 including modern inputs such as improved varieties, fertilizer, and agrochemica

 yields.
 The actor-farmer then shows what inputs s/he used and what recommended
 practices s/he followed to successfully increase his/her yields.
 The choice of what inputs and practices to promote in this video was based
 on key informant interviews conducted in May 2017 with agronomists, maize
 breeders, district agricultural officers and other government staff, extension
 workers, and maize farmers.
 The information provided in the video is also generally consistent with
 the package of recommendations promoted by the Ugandan Ministry of Agriculture,

 The video also contained content on the costs and benefits of the different
 practices and inputs being promoted, and recommended that viewers take
 a long-term perspective on improving their maize cultivation by starting

First, respondents are considered knowledgeable about recommended plant
 spacing and seed rate if they correctly answered that the best spacing
 is two and a half feet between rows and one foot between plants, with one

 Second, respondents are considered knowledgeable about combining practices
 if they correctly answered that they would allocate 40,000 Ugandan shillings
 to buy improved seed and fertilizer, as combining inputs is a better strategy
 than putting all the eggs in one basket.
 Third, respondents are considered knowledgeable about optimal weeding if
 they correctly answered that weeding is most important during the first
 four weeks after planting.
 Fourth, respondents are considered knowledgeable about fall armyworm

 For each maize plot within the household, we thus recorded if the following
 decisions were made by the female co-head, jointly or by the male co-head:
 whether to plant maize on the plot; when to start planting the maize on
 the plot; what spacing of maize plants to use and how many maize seeds
 per hill to plant on the plot; what strategies to use to control striga
 on the plot; and when to start weeding on the plot.
 To aggregate this at the household level, we consider the proportion of
 maize plots within the household on which the female co-head reported that
 she made the decision alone, that the decision was taken jointly with her
 husband, or that her husband took the decision alone

Decision making is central to women's empowerment.
 However, we 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1609752458
may 
\change_unchanged
also want to check if the practices and inputs that were recommended in
 the video were also implemented on the plots.
 For instance, it may be that, due to the video, women gain voice in the
 decision making process, but if additional investments are needed (for
 instance in terms of labour time or inputs), they may still be constrained
 and decide to use a second best technology.
 We thus also consider the proportion of the household’s maize plots for
 which the female co-head decided about a particular practice alone and
 adopted the practice that was recommended in the video.
 Similarly, we consider the proportion of the household’s maize plots for
 which the female and male co-head decided and adopted a recommended practice
 jointly, as well as the proportion of household's maize plots for which
 the male co-head decided unilaterally and adopted the practice that was
 promoted in the video.

 Similar to adoption of recommended practices, we consider the proportion
 of the household’s maize plots for which a particular input was used and
 this was decided individually by the female co-head.
 Similar outcomes for input adoption were constructed for joint input adoption
 and for unilateral adoption by the male co-head.
 Also here, adoption of different inputs is aggregated in a women’s input
 use index, a joint input use index, and a men’s input use index respectively.

 The area of production is the total area (in acres) of female-managed maize

 Yield (in kg per acre) is the total amount of maize produced on female-managed

 household.
 A secondary, more subjective indicator for yield effects is an indicator

Judged by the overall index, the left panel of the figure shows that exclusively

 reduced men's outcomes.
 Joint outcomes were not affected by this shift in information targeting
 from the male co-head to the female co-head.
 This result is

\change_inserted 1966826031 1609757614
 a positive impact on women's knowledge index.
 It further shows
\change_unchanged

 women's decision-making index and

 all decision making indicators we measured.
 The largest effect is found for the decision about what to do against striga:
 in the control households where

men 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609757141

 the household on strategies to combat the 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609757151

 This increased to 20 percent of the

\change_deleted 1966826031 1609757194

 We register even larger reductions in men's unilateral decision making
 as a result of targeting 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1609757243

male co-heads
\change_unchanged
: continuing with the example of decisions related to fighting striga, we
 see that in the comparison group men decided on 30 percent of the 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1609757276

The change in intra-household decision making 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609757461
as a result of targeting information to female co-heads alone 
\change_unchanged
does not seem to fully translate into actual adoption of the agronomic practices
 that were recommended in the video,
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609757861
 as is evident from the statistically insignificant effect on women's adoption
 index.
 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1609757873
 but there are some indications that
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609757920
But the positive significant effect on women's input use index indicates
 that
\change_unchanged
 empowering women with information increased the likelihood that they adopted
 improved inputs
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609771310
 unilaterally
\change_unchanged
.
 In particular, Appendix Table

 shows a of significant increase in the use of urea and hybrid seed, albeit
 from a very low base.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows that the only cases where the shift in decision making
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609757958
 about recommended agronomic practices
\change_unchanged
 also translated into action is for the 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609771423
female-decided 
\change_unchanged
adoption of the recommend

\change_deleted 1966826031 1609771379
on how
\change_unchanged
 to fight striga and the recommendation to start weeding about 18 to 20
 days after planting.
 The fact that both of these practices are related to weeding may indicate
 that it is easier for women to adopt practices that are culturally more
 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1609757993
acceptable
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609758026

\change_unchanged
.
 At the same time, the fact that women also increased 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609758040
their 
\change_unchanged
use of urea and hybrid seed seems to suggest that 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609758083
access to financial resources 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1609758085

Interestingly, unlike for the female co-head, the presence of the spouse
 in the exposure process does influence the knowledge of the male co-head,
 who appears to learn somewhat less when information is provided to the
 couple than when this information is targeted to him alone, although the
 reduction is only significant at the 10 percent level and only for the
 knowledge index (see Appendix Table

A question that remains is the extent to which the increased efforts by
 women that result from exclusively giving them extension information, in
 terms of applying the recommended practices and inputs and larger areas

 Indeed, we observe that the time women spent on preparing fields and weeding
 went up by 1.4 and 3.3 person-days/maize season, respectively, as a result
 of providing only the female co-head

 while controlling for the orthogonal treatment.
 However, for some outcomes and hypotheses, interaction effects may be more
 relevant.
 For example, while we may not find that women learn more if the messenger

 where a video with a female 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609764348

 Or, providing information to a couple may only translate in increased joint

 maize farmers
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609764446

 We do this through a field experiment in the form of a factorial design

The results of this study clearly show that significant advances in women’s
 empowerment in agriculture
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609766400
 in terms of knowledge, decision making, input use and achievements in terms
 of maize production
\change_unchanged
 can be made by giving women direct and exclusive access to 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609766300
ICT-mediated agricultural 
\change_unchanged
extension information.
 Providing information to the couple leads to increased 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609766411
jointly decided 
\change_unchanged
use of improved inputs and recommended practices 
\change_deleted 1966826031 1609766322
on jointly managed maize plots
\change_unchanged
.
 Furthermore, the results of this study suggest that women as role models,
 through peer effects, gender homophily effects, and/or through challenging
 role incongruity, influence women and men in different ways.
 In particular,
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609773704
 men’s unilateral decision making seems to reduce when they are shown a
 video where both a man and a woman give information as a couple and are
 portrayed as equally important actors in successful maize farming instead
 of a video with a man as messenger and role model.

Our study reveals that, consistent with non-unitary household models, informatio
n is not fully shared between household members.
 As a result, targeting particular individuals within the household has
 real effects.
 This is something that needs to be recognized by generic 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609766758
agricultural 
\change_unchanged
extension systems that, often for reasons of convenience, mainly inform
 the male co-head within the household.
 We further find some evidence that 
\change_inserted 1966826031 1609772775
including women as 
\change_unchanged
role models work, both directly by increasing aspirations of women and indirectl
y by challenging the idea that maize growing is a male activity.

 find may be due to the fact that our intervention was relatively light.
 A 10 minute video, even though screened twice, is still quite different
 from a two hour feel good movie or first hand experience with women leaders
 over the course of multiple years of quota policy.
 Norms defining women's and men's role in agriculture may also be harder
 to change than in other contexts

 Finally, it would be interesting to look at outcomes in the longer run,
 as changing norms takes time.
