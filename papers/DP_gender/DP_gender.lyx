\begin_layout Title
Designing for effectiveness and inclusivity: The role of gender attributes
 in video-enabled agricultural extension campaigns
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Decision making is often hampered by knowledge constraints, hence simply
 providing information often makes a big difference.
 At the same time, seemingly small design attributes of information campaigns—th
e way the information is delivered, who delivers the information, or who
 is targeted by the message—can result in significant differences in effectivene
ss and inclusivity.
 In the context of a video-enabled agricultural extension information campaign,
 this study assesses how changing the gender of the person who provides
 the information and the gender of the person who receives the information
 affects effectiveness and inclusivity of the campaign.
 Our study relies on a field experiment conducted among smallholder maize
 farmers in Uganda.
 Effectiveness is judged by household level changes in knowledge, adoption,
 productivity and welfare.
 Inclusivity is assessed by gender dis-aggregating outcomes and through
 the assessment of changes in intra-household decision-making.
 Our experimental design allows us to test a range of hypotheses related
 to intra-household cooperation and bargaining power, gender stereotypes
 in agricultural production, and gender homophily effects.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often, optimal decision making among poor people in developing countries
 is hampered by a lack of critical pieces of information, the inability
 to benefit from learning externalities 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1086/601447"

\end_inset

, failure to notice vital information 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1093/qje/qju015"

\end_inset

, or false beliefs and erroneous perceptions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "10.1257/app.3.1.1,doi:10.1162/qjec.2010.125.2.515"

\end_inset

.
 In many instances, information campaigns designed to address these information
 inefficiencies can lead to significant differences in decision-making 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "banerjee2011poor"

\end_inset

.
 In the context of agricultural technology adoption among smallholder farmers
 in developing countries, information inefficiencies are particularly important,
 as a lack of information about the existence, use, and profitability of
 modern inputs, improved technologies, and recommended management practices
 have been documented to be a major constraint to productivity growth, sustainab
le intensification, and food security 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1086/451461,jack2013market"

\end_inset

.
 As such, agricultural extension programs and advisory services—often provided
 as a public service—are viewed as necessary to improving agricultural outcomes,
 especially in developing countries.
 More recently, with new possibilities offered by information and communications
 technology (ICT), an abundance of pilot projects and commercial products
 have entered the market with a focus on revitalizing agricultural extension
 in developing countries 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Aker2011"

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, not all information campaigns are equally successful, and seemingly
 small design attributes—the way information is delivered, who delivers
 the information, and who was targeted—can significantly influence effectiveness
 and inclusivity.
 This is also the case for agricultural advisory services, where outcomes
 are mixed at best, and gender differentiated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "davis2008extension"

\end_inset

.
 A growing body of evidence also suggests that not all ICT-mediated extension
 approaches are equally effective in achieving outcomes such as increased
 rates of technology adoption, and higher crop yields of man and woman farmers,
 or improvements in household welfare and intra-household equity.
 This is partly due to the fact that most agronomic information campaigns
 ignore the existence of information asymmetries within smallholder farm
 households and the fact that these households are composed of multiple
 decision makers, each with their own preferences, skills and access to
 resources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper explores the role and importance of gender-related attributes
 in designing successful agricultural extension information campaigns, focusing
 on (i) the gender of the recipient of the information (or gender composition
 of recipients of information), and (ii) the gender of the messenger providing
 the information (or gender composition of providers of information).
 We study the relative importance of these two design attributes through
 a randomized control trial (RCT) that takes the form of a 3 by 3 factorial
 experiment.
 A first factor corresponds to the gender of the recipient (or gender compositio
n of recipients) of the information, and has 3 levels: (i) the information
 is provided to the husband only within the household, (ii) the information
 is provided to the wife alone, or (iii) the information is given to the
 both husband and wife together.
 Orthogonal to this first factor, a second factor is placed, corresponding
 to the gender of the messenger (or gender composition of messengers) providing
 the information.
 Similar to the first factor, this second factor has 3 levels: (i) a man
 alone provides all the information, (ii) a woman alone provides all the
 information, or (iii) the information is provided by a couple (man and
 woman together).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The factorial design allows us to test a range of hypotheses grounded in
 different strands of the literature.
 First, in the context of cooperative versus non-cooperative household models,
 we test if reducing information asymmetries within the household increases
 household level outcomes and reduces intra-household inequality.
 Second, deriving from the same theoretical framework, we test if priming
 a cooperative approach to farming within the household also translates
 into more cooperation within the household.
 Third, borrowing from the literature on intra-household bargaining, we
 test if arming women with information increases women decision making in
 agriculture and outcomes on women managed plots.
 Fourth, quite a few recent studies underscore the importance of female
 role models to encourage entry of women in male dominated sectors, and
 we test if showing female role models engaged in maize production alters
 household level and individual outcomes.
 Finally, some studies suggest gender homophily effects in agricultural
 extension, where information that comes from someone with the same gender
 appears to be more effective.
 We test if matching the gender of the recipient of the information with
 the gender of the messenger leads to better outcomes then when gender of
 recipient and messenger differs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We work with 3,600 farm households sampled from a population of nuclear
 households cultivating maize across five districts of eastern Uganda
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A nuclear household is defined as a household containing both one male and
 one female member who take decisions as head of household either jointly
 or singly in their respective spheres of responsibility.
 It thus excludes single headed households or polygamous households.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Maize is a key crop in the region, and is important for both home consumption
 and as a source of income.
 However, yields are low compared to what is attainable, especially on women
 managed plots.
 Modern input use is very low, and farmers use traditional agronomic practices.
 Again, this is particularly the case on women managed plots.
 Furthermore, access to agricultural extension is limited, generally targeted
 to the man within the household, and most of the agricultural extension
 agents are male.
 Taken together, this suggests ample scope for increasing both household
 level and individual level outcomes by stimulating adoption through carefully
 designed agricultural extension information campaigns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information treatments are implemented as short videos, that are shown
 to participating households according to the experimental design.
 Corresponding to the first factor regarding the recipient of information,
 a video is shown to (i) only the male co-head within the household, (ii)
 only the female co-head within the household, or (iii) the male and female
 co-head together within the household.
 To implement the second factor, related to the gender of the person that
 provides the information, we essentially produced three versions of the
 video.
 These three videos are identical, except for the fact that, in the first
 version all the information is provided by a male farmer.
 In the second version of the video, the male actor is replaced by an actress
 who provides all the information.
 In the third version of the video, the information is given by a man and
 a woman together acting as a couple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The video itself provides technical information related to maize cultivation,
 such as optimal spacing and seed rate, soil fertility management, and the
 importance of quality seed, among others.
 Some of this information is new, while other information is likely to be
 known but not actively applied.
 Apart from offering agronomic advice, the video also promotes a more commercial
 attitude towards maize growing, underscoring for instance the importance
 of investing now to gain more in the future.
 The message is packaged in an appealing story, brought by model farmers
 that explain how they also used to struggle with low yields but became
 successful farmers after embracing modern inputs and improved agronomic
 practices.
 In sum, the video is designed to change farmer behavior through awareness,
 skill, and aspirational channels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Changes in efficiency at the household level as a result of the treatments
 is judged by changes in four different families of outcomes: knowledge,
 adoption of technologies and practices, productivity, and well-being.
 Knowledge is judged by a short quiz consisting of four multiple choice
 questions.
 Adoption is measured as the implementation of 10 different technologies
 or practices, such as for instance the use of recommended spacing and seed
 rate, inorganic fertilizer use, timely weeding, etc.
 Production outcomes are the quantity of maize produced and area under cultivati
on (combined in yield), and also a more subjective measure of production.
 Well-being is measured by consumption expenditure, standard food security
 questions, and subjective measures of relative well-being.
 To assess changes in inclusivity due to changing the gender related design
 features, knowledge, adoption and production is dis-aggregated by gender,
 and inquire about intra-household decision making.
 Outcomes within each family are summarized in a single index to guard against
 over-rejection of the null due to multiple comparison.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the farm household level, we find that providing information to farmers
 through short video messages increases their knowledge about modern inputs,
 improved technologies, and recommended practices.
 In addition, farm households that were exposed to the video are also more
 likely to adopt a range of inputs, technologies, and practices that feature
 in the video.
 We also find clear effects on production, with average maize yields 14
 percent higher than in control households.
 However, these results do not translate into greater well-being.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We further find that if the extension information is brought by a woman
 or a couple, men to take less unilateral decisions related to maize farming,
 possibly due to the fact that the assumption that maize is a male activity
 is called into question.
 Furthermore, we find that if women farmers are also involved in receiving
 extension information (either alone or as part of the couple), women co-head
 take more decisions and also adopt more technologies and practices on the
 plots they manage.
 However, this increase in adoption does not lead to higher productivity
 on women managed plots.
 This may be because women tend to adopt technologies or practices that
 are relatively cheap (such as weeding), whereas men tend to adopt more
 expensive technologies such as inorganic fertilizer.
 The effects on yields of the former are generally much smaller than the
 yield effects of the latter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our research design also allows us to explore the consequences of reducing
 information asymmetries within households by comparing outcomes of households
 where the information was given to only one of the spouses (either the
 man or the woman) to outcomes of households where the information was given
 to the couple.
 While we do not find differences in knowledge, indicating that, to some
 extent, information is shared between spouses, we see that reducing information
 asymmetries leads to more joint decision-making, more adoption on jointly
 managed plots, and increased productivity under joint management.
 Encouraging cooperation on the household farm, by showing couples cooperate
 in the video, leads to more joint decision making and increases adoption
 on jointly managed plots.
 Finally, our research suggests that women are more likely to adopt modern
 technologies and recommended agronomic practices on their plots if the
 information is delivered by a woman.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
 The next section lays out the main research questions and corresponding
 hypotheses.
 Section 3 explains the factorial design and corresponding sampling frame.
 Section 4 describes the study site and context, while Section 5 describes
 the interventions used as the treatment in this experiment.
 Section 6 provides the results, starting with baseline characteristics
 and balance checks for the different comparisons.
 Next, the analysis of the household level overall impact of showing a video
 is presented.
 We then test the different hypotheses with respect to the gender attributes
 and focus more on individual-level outcomes and intra-household effects
 to assess differences in inclusivity.

\begin_layout Section*
Research Questions and Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary focus of this study is to test alternative designs for improving
 the effectiveness and inclusiveness of agricultural extension services.
 We examine the relative importance of two design features (the gender of
 the messenger and the gender of the viewer) to address the issue of gender
 bias in the provision of agricultural extension services and the dissemination
 of information to smallholder farmers

key "Doss200127,FLETSCHNER20111422,peterman2011understanding,QUISUMBING2010581"

\end_inset

.
 Often, extension agents are male, and their default strategy for disseminating
 information on crop management is to target one decision-maker in a household,
 which is generally the man in nuclear households.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first research question is related to differentiating between cooperative
 and non-cooperative household models, and asks if providing information
 to only one individual within the household is equally effective as providing
 both co-heads with information (H1).
 The assumption that extension messages targeting one household member will
 spread to other household members—including women and youth—may be false
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:fpr:ifprid:1411"

\end_inset

: Men do not necessarily discuss production decisions or share information
 with women household members, especially if extension messages focus on
 men's priorities and crops 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fletschner2011gender"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is indeed some evidence that information related to agricultural technolog
y or recommended agronomic practices in not fully shared between household
 members, and the reducing these information inequalities leads to beneficial
 outcomes both at the individual level and at the household level.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "kabunga2012heterogeneous"

\end_inset

 find that female farmers are less likely to adopt tissue-culture banana
 technology in Kenya, but would have an equal chance to adopt the technology
 were they able to acquire sufficient information about it.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1093/erae/jbv039"

\end_inset

 investigate the effect of gendered approaches to extension training among
 farmers in South Kivu, DR Congo, and find that joint male and female participat
ion leads to the highest adoption rates for several key technologies and
 practices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second, related research question concerns the relative bargaining power
 of the actors within agricultural households, and how allocating additional
 productive resources to one individual (in this case, information) changes
 the balance (see, e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Doss200127"

\end_inset

).
 In this hypothesis, we compare instances where information was only provided
 to the husband within the household, and compare this to instances where
 the wife also benefited from the information campaign (H2).

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, we explore the gender dimensions of crop production by investigating
 the extent to which farms are managed at the household level in a cooperative
 manner, e.g., through joint decision-making between and among male and female
 co-heads of household.
 Substantial inefficiencies in the allocation of factors of production across
 the plots controlled by different members of the household have been documented

 evaluates interventions that aim to increase cooperation among coffee farmers
 in Uganda and documents more joint management, increased adoption of sustainabl
e and efficient farming practices, and higher levels of perceived well-being,
 among others.
 We investigate if priming a cooperative approach to farming affects outcomes,
 both at the household and at the individual level (H3).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fourth, there is a growing literature that investigates the importance of
 role models to increase participation of women in sectors that are traditionall
y male dominated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:smu:ecowpa:1705,riley"

\end_inset

.
 In conservative and patriarchal settings, responsibilities may be gender
 differentiated, with men playing a larger role in marketing or in the cultivati
on of crops that have a higher monetary value (such as coffee and maize),
 and women responsible for reproductive agricultural activities and roots
 and tubers for home consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "njuki2011linking"

\end_inset

.
 Such gender stereotypes may be challenged by showing women role models
 successfully engaging in activities that are traditionally considered male
 activities (H4).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fifth, evidence suggests that in certain contexts, gender homophily effects—in
 which men learn more from other men and women learn more from other women—may
 dominate other intra-household information-sharing effects (H5).
 Homophily effects have been documented in a variety of contexts, with often
 powerful implications for the information agents receive, the attitudes
 they form, and the interactions they experience 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "mcpherson2001birds"

\end_inset

.
 In conservative and strongly patriarchal rural societies, connections between
 people who occupy equivalent roles may be particularly strong, making communica
tion and relationship formation easier and increasing the likelihood of
 diffusion and adoption of technologies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doss200127"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More broadly, this study also contributes to the literature on how ICTs
 can increase the uptake of improved management practices among smallholder
 farmers—a topic that has received considerable attention in recent years
 but has lacked sufficient evidence on which approaches work and for whom
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1111/agec.12314"

\end_inset

.
 The role of ICTs in improving access to information on crop management—as
 compared to improving access to market and price information—is a particularly
 challenging topic.
 Several studies have reported positive impacts of ICTs applied to extension
 services.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:hbs:wpaper:13-047"

\end_inset

 found that SMSs pushed to farmers in Gujarat, India generated positive
 effects on crop choice and pesticide-use decision, and that the introduction
 of an IVR system significantly increased cumin and cotton yields.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2016.1146700"

\end_inset

 found that a multi-media mobile phone-based product linked to expert advisory
 services increased farmer's awareness and knowledge about specific solutions
 to their production constraints in Madhya Pradesh, India.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "maredia2017can"

\end_inset

, on the other hand, found that while mobile phone-based animated videos
 shown to farmers in Burkina Faso induced learning and understanding, it
 was no more effective in encouraging adoption than conventional approaches
 to information provision.
 In Uganda—the site of our study—Grameen Foundation had some success using
 smartphones to provide agriculture-related information to farmers through
 ICT-empowered community knowledge workers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/1369118X.2016.1200644"

\end_inset

.
 However, it remains to be seen how far these effects can be generalized,
 and questions about cost-effectiveness, scalability, and accountability
 often remain unaddressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we contribute to long-standing research efforts to document and
 measure the adoption and impact of improved agricultural technologies and
 management practices among smallholder farmers.
 There are many reasons for the observed low rates of adoption of improved
 technologies and practices among smallholder farm households, including
 lack of access to credit and insurance, poorly developed labour markets,
 and asymmetries of information within markets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1086/451461,jack2013market"

\end_inset

.
 Our contribution is methodological in nature in recognition of two important
 points.
 First, few studies apply sufficiently rigorous methods to address concerns
 about sample selection bias and causal identification in the study of technical
 change in developing-country agriculture 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2010recent"

\end_inset

.
 Second, few studies on ICT-enabled extension are replicated in differing
 contexts and populations to increase both generalizable findings and nuanced
 insights on the impact pathways through which ICT operates on farmer's
 decision-making about technology adoption.
 Our study adds to this growing body of literature by adapting a design
 that is similar to work in progress in Ethiopia

\begin_layout Standard
The different hypotheses are tested with a field experiment, where the experimen
tal unit is the household.
 The experiment is implemented as a 3 by 3 factorial design to which a separate
 control group is added.
 Two different factors, placed orthogonal to each other, each have three
 levels.
 The first factor corresponds to the person who provides the information
 (

 Similarly, the second factor corresponds to the person who receives the

), also with three levels (male, female, and couple).
 The design, together with the sample size (number of households) in each

 factorial design).
 This third factor related to the technology that was used to deliver the
 information.
 The levels of this factor aim to measure incremental effects, and corresponded
 to (i) video alone; (ii) video plus access to interactive voice response
 service; and (iii) video plus access to interactive voice response service

\begin_layout Standard
The design in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Experimental-Design"

\end_inset

 allows us to test the five hypotheses outlined above.
 In addition, as we have added a separate control group of households that
 did not receive the information treatment, we can also test the impact
 of the information treatment itself.
 We thus start by comparing average household level outcomes among farm
 households that received information (irrespective of the gender of the
 person within the household the information was given to and the gender
 of the person who provided the information) to average outcomes of farming
 households that did not benefit form the information campaign (Control).
 This gives us the average treatment effect for the information treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test if reducing information asymmetries within the household increases
 efficiency of information at the household level and affects outcomes at
 the individual level (H1), we compare outcomes of households where the
 information was given to both husband and wife together to outcomes of
 households where the information was targeted to only one individual (either
 the husband of the wife).
 Similarly, to see if empowering the woman within the household with information
 leads to changes at both household or individual levels, we compare outcomes
 of households where the woman was also involved (either alone or as part
 of the couple) to cases where the information was given only to the husband.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next two hypotheses can be tested as main effects of the factor that
 corresponds to the gender of the person who provides the information.
 For instance, to test if priming a cooperative approach to farming has
 an impact (H3), we compare outcomes or households where the information
 was given by a single person (either a man or a woman) to outcomes of household
s where the information was provided by a man and woman together.
 The hypothesis that gender stereotypes can be challenged by involving a
 women as a messenger (H4) can be tested by comparing outcomes of households
 where a woman also provided information (either alone or a part of a couple)
 to outcomes of households where the information was provided by a man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The homophily hypothesis (H5) can be tested by looking at interactions between
 the messenger and the recipient factor.
 In particular, outcomes of households where gender of messenger and gender
 of recipient differs (ie messenger is male and recipient is female and
 messenger is female and recipient is male) are compared to outcomes of
 households where gender of recipient were matched with gender of the messenger
 (where both messenger and recipient are male and both messenger and recipient
 are female).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sample size and its distribution over different treatment combinations
 is based on a series of power calculations.
 Instead of determining power analytically, we used simulation techniques.
 Simulation allows one to sample from actual data of outcome variables instead
 of relying on a theoretical distribution with an assumed mean and standard
 deviation.
 With this approach, it is also straightforward to build in flexibility,
 such as allowing for more than one treatment arm, or accounting for sampling
 design effects such as clustered sampling.
 Power calculations were based on two outcome variables, one that reflects
 efficiency at the household level (maize yield defined as maize harvested
 per unit of area planted) and one that reflects inclusiveness (the gender
 yield gap, where women-managed plots are farmed less intensively than male-mana
ged plots resulting in significantly lower yields).
 The power calculations and their underlying assumptions are described in
 detail in the pre-analysis plan of this study

\begin_layout Standard
We conducted the field experiment among maize farmer in Uganda.
 Maize is widely consumed throughout much of Uganda, yet its value-to-weight
 ratio is sufficiently high to also make it an important traded commodity.
 Therefore, efforts to increase maize productivity at the farm-household
 level are an important dimension of Uganda's strategy to increase food
 security and reduce poverty through both consumption and income channels.
 Yet maize yields in Uganda are low when compared to neighboring countries
 and global averages.
 While research station trials conducted in Uganda report potential yields
 of up to 1.8 metric tons per acre, data from the Uganda National Household
 Survey 2005/06 indicate that average maize yields are much lower at about
 640 kg per acre for the main growing season

 In addition, there is significant gender related yield gap.
 Estimates suggest that yields on women managed plots are on average about
 20 percent lower than on male managed plots

At the same time, the use of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer
 and management practices such as row planting is very low in Uganda.
 For example, the use of inorganic fertilizer is on average just 2.4 kg of
 nutrient per acre per year, compared to Kenya (75 kg/ac), Rwanda (70 kg/ac),
 and Tanzania (15 kg/ac).
 Use of modern inputs is likely to be particularly low on women managed
 plots, as it is well know that they have less access to productive resources.
 Furthermore, access to extension is also low.
 A recent survey of public service delivery found that only 11% of rural
 households have received a visit by an extension worker in the last year.
 This is only 8 percent among female headed households.
 The same survey also found that only about one in five extension officers
 for crops are women

Maize is especially important in eastern Uganda.
 We sampled from five districts in eastern Uganda known for their maize
 production: Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo, and Namutumba.
 From this, we removed town councils and also two sub-counties that consisted
 of islands in lake Victoria.
 We used two-stage cluster sampling to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, we first selected parishes randomly, with probability weights
 proportional to the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all the households, from which we randomly
 sampled households to be included in the study.
 Outcomes within villages are likely to be correlated, for instance due
 to local weather conditions, or development programs that are implemented
 in certain areas.
 We therefore used the village as a blocking factor: in each village, we
 made sure all possible treatment combinations related two factors (plus
 control) were administered.
 The experimental design described above shows that the messenger and the
 recipient factor combine into nine different treatment combinations.
 Adding the control leads to 10 different households being selected in each
 village.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In eastern Uganda, there are two maize cropping seasons.
 For our study, we concentrated on the second maize-growing season of the
 year 2017, which runs from approximately August 2017 to January 2018 and
 is characterized by a shorter period of rainfall than the first maize-growing
 season.
 During this second season, the complete cycle from planting to harvest
 requires 3 to 3.5 months, and farmers tend to cultivate early-maturing but
 lower yielding maize varieties as a result.
 Fields are prepared in August, planted in September.
 Harvesting begins in mid to late December and, at higher elevations, can
 continue until mid January.

Intervention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information treatment was implemented in the form of short videos that
 were shown on 10-inch Android tablet computers.
 Videos were screened by a trained field enumerator, who sat with an individual
 farmer or a farmer-couple, depending on the household's random assignment
 to a particular treatment group for the recipient factor.
 In accordance with the second factor in our factorial designs (varying
 the gender composition of the person(s) who provide the information), three
 videos were produced: one where the information was provided by a male
 farmer, one where the information was provided by a female farmer, and
 one where the information was provided by a couple (man+woman).
 Apart from varying this attribute of the treatment, the form and content
 of the three videos remained the same.
 The control group received a placebo treatment, which was a music video
 of traditional dancing that contained no information related to farming.
 Videos were screened twice to each person (or couple) in the sample, once
 before the time for planting maize (July 2017) and once around planting
 time (August 2017).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information contained in the treatment group's video is expected to
 positively influence maize yields by encouraging the adoption of several
 improved technologies and practices which, in turn, are expected to positively
 affect farm-household income.
 The topics included in the video script were obtained from qualitative
 interviews with key informants that were conducted in May 2017, and included
 maize farmers, value chain actors, maize breeders, extension workers, district
 agricultural officers, and other government staff and experts.
 We asked experts to rank technologies and practices form most effective
 (in terms of potential to increase yields) to least, and from least known
 and implemented to most widely known and implemented.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This was complemented with analysis of secondary data, where yield response
 for different technologies and practices was estimated, as well as use
 by farmers.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main factors affecting maize productivity that were identified by these
 key informants were related to pests, poor soils, and poor seed quality.
 The three most important 
\series bold
pests
\series default
 that affect maize farming are striga (in particular the 
\emph on
Striga hermonihica
\emph default
 variety), maize stalk borer (
\emph on
Busseola fusca
\emph default
), and, more recently, fall armyworm (
\emph on
Spodoptera frugiperda
\emph default
).
 We focus on striga management in the videos because it was deemed more
 immediately problematic to our population of interest than maize stalk
 borer, and because, at the time this field experiment was conducted, there
 was no consistent strategy being promoted to address fall armyworm.
 Striga, also called witchweed, is a parasitic plant that feeds off the
 roots of maize, leading to severe stunting of the maize plant.
 Because the nutritional needs of maize are greatest at the early stages
 of growth, weeding of striga becomes less effective in curbing losses as
 the season progresses.
 Striga can reduce production from about 30 percent up to total loss of
 the crop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No single method is effective in controlling striga.
 Progress has been made in developing varieties that are resistant to the
 herbicide imazapyr and can be supplied with a imazapyr seed coating to
 contain striga before it can damage the host plant.
 However, the seeds of this variety on offer in Uganda are expensive at
 10,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) per kg (seeds of other common/popular varieties
 cost between 6,000 and 8,000 UGX/kg).

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At the time this study was conducted, the official exchange rate was approximate

 In addition, it does poorly under dry conditions and in areas where the
 rains are short such as in eastern Uganda.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the near future, it is expected that the same herbicide-resistance trait
 and seed-coating technology will be released in early-maturing varieties
 such as Longe 10, which are preferred in eastern Uganda.
 See https://striga.aatf-africa.org/.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Crop rotation with sweet potato or beans can also reduce striga infestation,
 as can applications of phosphatic fertilizer to make up for the nutrients
 drained by the parasitic weed.
 Weeding is also a strategy to control striga, and is most effective in
 the weed's earliest growth stages, before it establishes itself on the
 maize plant's root system and before it has a chance to spread via seed
 dispersal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Poor soils
\series default
, exhausted by continuous cultivation with little rotation is the second
 main limiting factor.
 Soils often lack macro-nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P)
 and potassium (K), and farmers in our study area rarely use organic or
 inorganic fertilizers in sufficient quantities to ameliorate these deficiencies
, either at the planting stage (when diammonium phosphate (DAP) or nitrogen-phos
phorous-potassium (NPK) applications are recommended), or at the vegetative
 growth stage (when top dressings of nitrogenous fertilizers such as Urea
 are recommended).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout eastern Uganda, maize farmers mainly rely on 
\series bold
seed saved from harvest
\series default
, which represents the third limiting factor identified by key informants.
 The reliance on saved (recycled) seeds tends to negate the significant
 yield advantages conferred by high-yielding maize hybrids, which require
 that new F1 seed be purchased at the start of each season to realize the
 gains conferred by heterosis or hybrid vigor.
 And even where farmers rely on recycled seed from improved open-pollinated
 varieties (OPVs) that do not require seasonal replacement, the gains from
 improvement tend to depreciate over three to four seasons, again requiring
 farmers to purchase new seed at regular intervals.
 According to the experts, gains from the improved genetic qualities of
 both maize hybrids and OPVs can increase yields between 30 and 200 percent,
 depending on climatic conditions and the complementary use of modern inputs
 and intensive management practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, there are also
\series bold
 crop management practices
\series default
 that affect yields, but the effects are generally smaller than those related
 to improved seeds and inorganic fertilizer use.
 The most important are timely planting, optimal plant spacing, and timely
 weeding.
 Timely planting in eastern Uganda implies that maize should be planted
 at the onset of the rains.
 However, many farmers delay planting for several reasons.
 For instance, they may not be certain that the rainy season has really
 started.
 There may also be bottlenecks in land preparation, where poorer farmers
 are often the last in line for the use of oxen or tractors.
 Experts estimate that for each day a farmer delays planting, yields are
 reduced by 1.5 percent.
 Optimal plant spacing implies that sowing should be structured so that
 plants are not too close to each other such that they compete for light
 and nutrients which, in turn, reduces yields.
 Plants that are too far from each other means space is wasted, also leading
 to lower yields.
 Related is the number of seeds that farmers plant in each hill.
 Farmers want to be sure of germination and put more than one seed, sometimes
 up to 5.
 If they all germinate, there is competition for nutrients and sun, resulting
 in stunted growth.
 Usually there is also not enough thinning, or this is done too late when
 competition has already occurred.
 One expert told us that standard spacing is 75cm x 60cm with two plants
 per hill.
 However, several experts mentioned a new way of plant spacing of 75cm x
 30cm with a reduced seed rate of 1 seed per hill which leads to a 35 percent
 increase in yields.
 Timely weeding implies that the first weeding should be done at 18 to 20
 days after planting, with a second weeding at two to three weeks after
 first weeding.
 From emergence to the

\end_inset

 stage (when the maize is at about knee height), the maize plant is a very
 poor competitor and unwanted stress such as weed competition must be prevented.
 A third weeding at the tasseling stage is optional, and depends on observed
 weed pressure after the second weeding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the above, a significant part of the video focuses on providing technical
 information on seed choice, soil nutrient management (including the promotion
 of both organic and inorganic fertilizer application), weeding (with particular
 attention on fighting striga), timely planting, and plant spacing.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that the videos did not include explicit information on the use of
 chemical pesticides which can be effective in addressing pests but may
 also be hazardous to humans, animals, and the environment.
 The decision to exclude such information was made following a determination
 by the study team that currently available content on pesticide use was
 insufficiently attentive to issues of safe handling, application, storage,
 and disposal of pesticides that are warranted in any study involving human
 research subjects.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We made sure to include information that is likely to be unknown to the
 farmer, based on findings from other studies that information is most valuable
 when individuals learn about a new technology or institutional innovation

 However, other studies also provide evidence of behavioral change occurring
 through the compounding or re-emphasis of common knowledge that, through
 repetition, becomes more salient to the individual

 Therefore, the video also contains information that farmers are assumed
 to know but do not seem to act upon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, not all constraints to maize productivity improvement are information
 deficiencies directly related to the use of inputs, technologies, and crop
 management practices.
 Often, missing information problems manifest indirectly, as uncertainty
 about the distribution of the farm-household's profit function.
 This includes uncertainty about the correlations between expected and actual
 returns, the inter-temporality of income streams, estimates of fixed and
 variable costs, hidden transactions costs, probabilities of adverse events,
 and a range of other variables that farmers may simply be unable to conceptuali
ze or measure

Farmers indeed often mention they do not use modern inputs because they
 have no money, suggesting liquidity is the main constraining factor, and
 thus instead of providing information, a more effective strategy would
 be to provide credit or subsidize inputs.
 Recent research, however, finds that despite what farmers claim, liquidity
 is often not the most important constraining factor.

 compare outcomes related to agricultural production between households
 that were given cash to households that were provided with insurance and
 find that when provided with insurance, farmers are able to find resources
 to increase expenditure on their farms.
 However, a recent study among rice farmers in Uganda does not find that
 providing objective information about the returns to different inputs and
 practices increased adoption

.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Thus, a significant portion of the videos also focuses on the costs and
 benefits of the different technologies and practices being promoted.
 In addition, the videos encourage long-term thinking, advising farmers
 to (a) start small and grow their farm enterprise over time, and (b) combine
 technologies and practices together rather than investing all of their
 money and effort into one single input, practice, or technology.
 In short, we encourage them to experiment with combinations of technologies
 and practices on a small scale in the initial season before reinvesting
 their gains for larger-scale replication in subsequent seasons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also pay attention to how the information is packaged and framed.
 For instance, it has been found that farmers find communicators who face
 agricultural conditions and constraints most comparable to their own to
 be the more persuasive than other communicators

 readily recognized as

 and who provide information that is framed as a success story.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The video starts with the farmer-actor or -actors introducing themselves
 (recall that three versions of this video were produced: one where the
 farmer-actor is male; one where the farmer-actor is female; and one where
 a pair of actors, one male and one female, act together).
 The farmer-actor talks about how she used to struggle with her maize production
 and how at one point in time, she decided things needed to change.
 It is shown how the farmer sells a hen, obtains a small loan from a friend,
 and uses these proceeds to buy small quantities of improved seed and fertilizer
 from a local retailer.
 The video then shows how the farmer prepares the field by collecting and
 applying manure.
 Next, the video details how the DAP is applied correctly, how maize seed
 are spaced at 75cm x 30cm intervals with 1 plant per hill, and what the
 correct timing of these activities should be.
 The video progresses to a field about 10 to 12 days after sowing when the
 maize has emerged from the soil, and the farmer-actor recommends to engage
 in gap filling to replace seeds that did not germinate, thereby preserving
 optimal plant density.
 The video proceeds to the field at 18 to 20 days after sowing, and the
 farmer-actor recommends how weeding should be conducted with particular
 attention to the identification of striga and the importance of follow-up
 weeding two to three weeks later.
 The video then advances to four weeks after planting, where the farmer-actor
 demonstrates how Urea top dressing is done and recommends one more round
 of weeding at the tasseling stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The video then turns to a discussion about investing to get higher yields
 over time.
 The farmer-actor points out that, while it may be difficult to raise cash,
 one can always start small (e.g., on one tenth of an acre) and reinvest the
 returns.
 She then explains that following recommended practices and using improved
 inputs led her to produce 2.5 bags of maize on a small plot, which she sold
 for UGX 125,000 with a profit of almost UGX 90,000—as compared to previously
 harvesting merely one bag from the same area at a profit of only UGX 40,000.
 She then explains that she reinvested the difference (UGX 50,000) to increase
 the area under intensive maize cultivation year after year such that, over
 time, she was able to cultivate an entire acre using modern inputs.
 In the final part of the video, she reiterates her experience and again
 encourages the viewer to try a similar approach.

 We then asked more specific questions related to maize farming, such as
 acreage and quantities produced in the last season.
 Furthermore, we asked if the household received agricultural extension
 service, whether it used improved seed, and whether fertilizer was applied.
 We also collected data on housing conditions (number of bedrooms) and distance
 to the nearest agro-input shop.

In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance"

\end_inset

, we provide descriptive statistics, and balance tests for a treatment versus
 control comparison and the first two hypotheses related to the recipient
 factor (H1 and H2).
 Averages for the entire sample are reported in the first column.
 We observe that few households that were included in our study had access
 to agricultural extension in the previous year (about 11 percent).
 We also observe that only about 20 percent of households reported to have
 used any fertilizer in the previous season and only about 38 percent reported
 to have used improved seed bought from a shop or agro-input dealer during
 the last cropping season.
 This suggests ample scope to increase intensification investments through
 extension.
 We also find that farmers produced on average only 286 kg of maize per
 acre in the first cropping season of 2017.
 This is substantially lower than the average yield of 640 kg per acre we
 find in data from the 2005/06 Uganda National Household Survey.
 The low yields may reflect the devastating impact of the fall armyworm
 outbreak in East Africa in 2017, but are also affected by adverse weather
 conditions

Balance is tested through calculating differences between treatment groups
 for each characteristic, as well as through a joint significance test (F-test)
 for each comparison.
 The second column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance"

\end_inset

, denoted T-C, compares baseline characteristics between households that
 were shown the intervention video and household that were shown a placebo
 video.
 For example, we see that yields prior to the intervention are about 21
 kg per acre higher in the group that was shown the video than in the group
 that was shown the placebo video.
 However, as can be inferred from the p-value, this difference is not significan
tly different from zero.
 In fact, for the placebo video versus intervention video comparison, we
 find that only the number of bedrooms is slightly lower, and this is only
 significant at the 10 percent level.
 We also find that the F-statistic can not be rejected.
 We can thus conclude that there is balance at baseline for the treatment
 versus control comparison.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance"

\end_inset

 present differences in baseline characteristics for households where the
 video was shown to the couple and households where the video was shown
 to an individual within the household, corresponding to H2.
 Here, there seems to be quite some imbalance at baseline.
 For instance, we see that households where the video was shown to a couple
 have lower yields as baseline, and have household heads that are on average
 3.4 years older than households where the video was shown to an individual
 co-head.
 The fact that they are significantly older is also reflected in the fact
 that these households are significantly larger.
 Furthermore, it seems households where both individuals were treated have
 heads that are more likely to have finished at least primary education.
 At the same time, they are less likely to have been using fertilizer in
 the previous period.
 Also according to the joint F-test, we can not reject the null that households
 in the two groups are the same based on the characteristics in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
The last column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 present differences in baseline characteristics for households where where
 the woman got to see the video (either alone or as part of the couple)
 and baseline characteristics for households where where the woman did not
 get to see the video.
 Also here, there seems to be quite some imbalance at baseline.
 Households where a woman was involved as a recipient seem to have significantly
 lower yields at baseline.
 For age of the head at baseline, we find this to be lower in the women
 involved subgroup.
 This must mean that household heads in the subgroup of households where
 the recipient is the woman must be particularly young at baseline: Indeed,
 in this group, age of the household head is almost 8 years lower.
 A similar imbalance that the one found in the previous comparison exists
 for the likelihood that the head finished at least primary education.
 We also find that at baseline, households where women were involved as
 recipients of information used less fertilizer and improved seed.
 The concerns related to balance for this hypothesis are confirmed by the
 significance of the joint F-test
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
what is the implication for results? do we address this imbalance in one
 way or another (matching?)? This is something that we need to take up in
 the next version of the paper.
 I suggest just controlling for these baseline characteristics for hypotheses
 where this is problematic.
 But I am not worried: the imbalance goes in the conservative direction:
 if we find that women eg adopt more after seeing the video, accounting
 for the fact that they are less educated to begin with will only make the
 effect stronger.
 I checked this already with a quick and dirty merge and my suspicion is
 confirmed.

In a similar way, Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance_gender"

\end_inset

 reports balance for the hypotheses base on the messenger factor (H3 and
 H4) and the gender homophily hypothesis (H5).
 The first column repeats the means for comparison.
 In the second column, we compare baseline characteristics of households
 where the version of the video featuring a couple was shown to baseline
 characteristics of households where the version of the video was shown
 in which an individual (man or woman) provides all the information.
 For this hypothesis, baseline characteristics are balanced, with only slightly
 more access to extension among households allocated to the couple messenger
 treatment.
 In column three, baseline averages of household characteristics are compared
 between the group where a woman was involved in the delivery of information
 (either alone or as a couple) and the group that saw the video where only
 a man provides the information.
 Also here, we do not find any systematic difference in baseline outcomes
 between these two groups, and the F-statistic is also insignificant.
 In column four, baseline averages of households in which the gender of
 the messenger and recipient are matched are compared to baseline outcomes
 of households where the gender differs.
 Also here, apart from a slightly larger household size among the matched
 sub-group, we do not find a systematic difference in baseline outcomes
 between these two groups.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Overall Impact of the Information Intervention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get an idea of the overall impact of our intervention, we start by comparing
 household level outcomes at endline between the households that were shown
 an agricultural extension information video (the treatment group) and household
s that were shown a placebo video that did not contain any agricultural
 related information (the control group).
 Note that, in the context of a factorial design, in this comparison, we
 can abstract from the two other factors.
 In other words, it does not matter what version of the video was shown
 and to whom within the household the video was shown.
 In other words, at the household level, we want to know if the video interventi
on worked, regardless of who the video was shown to within the household,
 or who provided the information within the video.
 As such, we can compare all the households in the control group to all
 the households in all of the 9 treatment combination cells together in
 Figure

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The experiment was set up to be powered to test particular hypotheses, hence
 a series of power calculations resulted in a different number of households
 in particular treatment cells.
 For instance, one of the most demanding hypotheses is the homophily hypothesis,
 for which only four treatment cells can be used, and so these four treatment
 cell have relatively larger sample sizes.
 As a result, a simple average over all treatment cells would weigh outcomes
 of larger cell more.
 We avoid this by comparing treatment and control in a regression framework,
 including the levels of the other two factors as controls.

We first test the impact of the video intervention on knowledge.
 This was done through a short quiz 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "feder2004acquisition,feder2004sending,masset2015does"

\end_inset

 consisting of four questions that were asked during the endline survey
 to each of the two spouses in the farm household separately - regardless
 of who was shown the video.
 For each question, three possible answers were read out to the respondent,
 who was then asked to indicate which answer he or she though was correct.
 The respondent was also allowed to indicate if he or she did not know the
 correct answer.
 The household was considered knowledgeable on a particular topic if at
 least one of the spouses indicated a correct answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first question was related to planting.
 In our video, we recommended a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with 1 plant per
 hill, and this was the correct option.
 Other possible answers included a spacing of 75cm x 60cm with two plants
 per hill, which is standard for many farmers and recommended by many agricultur
al extension agents, and an intermediate alternative of 75cm x 30cm with
 2 seeds per hill.
 Because our video recommended a technique that deviates from what is assumed
 to be standard spacing, we assume that the recommended practice is new
 to most of the farmers.
 The second question is less related to technical knowledge, but more to
 viewing farming as a business.
 In the video, we paid ample attention to promoting an approach where farmers
 start small and grow over time by reinvesting, and we emphasized the benefits
 of combining inputs rather than investing only in e.g., improved seed.
 We want to see if farmers internalize this advice and ask what a successful
 farmer would do if he or she only has 40,000 shillings.
 The correct answer is to use this sum to purchased improved seed and fertilizer
 and start intensified farming on a small area.
 Alternative options were to: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

use all the money to buy hybrid seeds, because without good seeds, yields
 will be low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

use all the money to buy fertilizer, because with poor soils, yields will
 be low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For the third questions, we asked if they knew when weeding is most important.
 The video showed that weeding is most important during the first four weeks
 after planting, as maize is a poor competitor for light and nutrients.
 It is assumed that most farmers would know this.
 Alternative answers were: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when the maize is knee high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when the maize is at tasseling stage,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Finally, we asked if farmers knew when spraying against fall armyworm is
 most effective.
 There was no information given about fighting Fall Armyworm in the intervention
, so unless one of our interventions encouraged farmers to search for additional
 information, we do not expect an impact.
 For this question, the correct option was: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

During the evening, as fall armyworm eats during night,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 while the other options were: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows that the video intervention leads to a clear increase in knowledge
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The index is based on the first three questions only, as we want to see
 if farmers learn from the intervention.
 As there is no information given on how to fight Fall Armyworm in the video,
 farmers are not expected to learn about it from the video.
 We indeed did not find a significant difference in the likelihood of answering
 the fourth question correctly between treatment and control.
 Adding the fourth question to the index made the index insignificant.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The figure shows that a household that was exposed to the video attains
 a score on the knowledge index that is about 0.25 standard deviations higher
 than the average household in the control group.
 This result is mainly driven by the first two questions.
 We find that in 16 percent of the households in the control group, at least
 one of the spouses gave the correct answer among the response options to
 the question on optimal maize seed spacing.
 This relatively low rate of correct responses is due to the fact that this
 is a fairly new and potentially controversial recommendation.
 We further find that among households that were shown a video, the proportion
 increases by 15 percentage points, to over 30 percent, and this difference
 is statistically significant.
 For the next question on input use, about 91 percent of households that
 were not shown the treatment video knew that is best to combine inputs
 instead of only using seed or fertilizer.
 Even though baseline knowledge is already high on this question, the video
 treatment further increased this knowledge by another 5.1 percentage points.
 For the question on weeding, we see that in about 95 percent of households
 in the control group, at least one of the spouses was able to correctly
 indicate that weeding is most important during the first four weeks after
 planting; the intervention does not seem to have a significant effect on
 knowledge about weeding
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In addition, our pre-analysis plan specified that we would drop from the
 analysis variables where 95 percent of outcomes are the same value to reduce
 the influence of outcomes with limited variation.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Finally, on the fall armyworm question, we find that households that were
 shown the video are no more likely than control households to know when
 one should spray to control the pest.
 This suggests that the videos did not encourage farmers to actively search
 information on important challenges that were not explicitly covered in
 the video.
 Overall, and as confirmed by the knowledge index, we conclude that the
 agricultural extension videos increased knowledge at the household level,
 and that this increase seems especially poignant for 
\emph on
new
\emph default
 information provided in the videos.

During the endline survey, we collected detailed information on the use
 of modern inputs and recommended farming practices on maize plots.
 Similar to the knowledge index, we construct an index that compares adoption
 rates for a range of technologies and practices between households in the
 control group that were shown the placebo video and households that were
 shown an intervention video
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The index consists of 10 different technologies and practices related to
 timing of planting, spacing and seed rate, striga management, timely weeding,
 soil fertility management, improved seed, seed replacement, combining inputs,
 use of chemicals, and hiring in of labour.
 Some of these can further be disaggregated, such as fertilizer use in organic
 and inorganic and improved seed in hybrid or OPVs.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 From this index, we conclude that there is also a clear and positive impact
 of the agricultural extension information campaign on the adoption of technolog
ies and practices: a household that was exposed to the video attains a score
 on the adoption index that is about 0.23 standard deviations higher than
 the average household in the control group.
 Looking beyond the aggregate index, we find that this is especially driven
 by the adoption of recommended spacing, adoption of the recommended way
 to fight striga and increased fertilizer use among the treatment group.
 The proportion of households that adopted the recommended spacing and seed
 rate increased from about 3 percent to 11 percent.
 The proportion of households that report fighting striga according to recommend
ations increases by 12 percent and we also record a 25 percent increase
 in fertilizer use (either organic or inorganic).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further disaggregation of fertilizer use reveals interesting changes in
 the allocation of different fertilizer types.
 Results are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

.
 The Table shows that already a substantial proportion of households in
 the control group (26 percent) are using DAP or NPK on at least one plot.
 This proportion decreases among households that were shown the video, but
 the difference is not statistically significant.
 At the same time, the use of urea, as well as the use of organic fertilizer,
 seems to increase in response to the intervention.
 In particular, the use of urea, which was very low in the control group,
 more than doubled as a result of showing the video.
 Inorganic fertilizer use also increased substantially, from 16 percent
 in control households to 24 percent in households shown the video.
 Overall, these findings suggest that the video's emphasis on combining
 inputs—and thereby managing soil nutrients in a more balanced manner—led
 treated farmers to reduce their use of DAP or NPK and increased their use
 of urea (and to a lesser extent inorganic fertilizer).

\begin_layout Standard
We now turn to the intervention's effects on production-related outcomes.
 During the endline survey, we asked both spouses separately to estimate
 how much maize was harvested from each plot.
 These quantities were then summed over the different maize plots for each
 spouse and the average between the two spouses was taken as the final estimate
 of household-level maize production.
 We find that overall, a typical household in our sample produced about
 460 kg of maize on an average of 1.13 acres.
 We further find that yields, defined as kilograms per acre, amounted to
 on average 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
shouldn't this be 407 kg/acre?No.
 In general mean(a)/mean(b) is not equal to mean(a/b).
 The fact that 460/1.13 is 407 is a coincidence.
 See also below that mean yield in the control group is 428, which should
 have been lower than the overall average yield.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

470 kg per acre.
 This is much higher than yields recorded at baseline (290 kg/acre) for
 the previous season, possibly because the rains were better during our
 intervention and farmers may have given greater attention to combating
 fall armyworm.
 Still, compared to figures from the latest agricultural census (around
 1,000 kg/acre, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) or more recent household survey data (such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

), yields were well below what might be considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in Uganda.
 This is also confirmed by the fact that in only 40 percent of households
 at least one spouse reported that yields were better than a typical year
 on at least one plot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Impact-of-video"

\end_inset

 again shows a positive impact of the video information intervention on
 an index summarizing production related outcomes.
 The index combines production and cultivated, which together define yields
 (kg/acre).
 It also includes a subjective measure by directly asking if yields were
 better or worse than in a normal year.
 ID we look at the components of the index individually, we find that household-
level production does not differ between the two groups.
 We do find, however, that households that were shown the video seemed to
 cultivate smaller plots: reported acreage is 11 percent smaller among household
s that were shown a video.
 The fact that the same quantity of output was reported on a smaller area
 of land means that households that were shown a video generated yields
 that were 14 percent higher than in control households.
 With mean yields in control households at 428 kg/acre, this puts mean yields
 among households where the video was shown at about 488 kg/acre.
 Further, in about 39 percent of households in the control group, at least
 one spouse indicates that yields were better than in a normal year on at
 least one plot.
 This is 2.7 percentage points higher among households that saw a video,
 but the difference is not significant.
 The fact that treated households seem to produce the same amount on less
 land can be traced back to the video, where it is emphasized that it is
 better to combine inputs and practices, and that as such, it is often better
 to start small.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at the impact of the information interventions on measures
 of well-being at the household level.
 Welfare is captured though self-assessment, as well as though consumption.
 We asked these questions only to the woman within the household, as we
 assume she has a better idea of consumption expenditure within the household
 and the general level of well-being.
 First, we asked if they feel their household is better off (as opposed
 to equally well off or worse off) in terms of income and consumption than
 the average households in their community.
 Similarly, we asked the woman in the household to indicate if she thought
 they were better off than six months ago.
 We also include two standard self assessed food security questions taken
 from the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS).
 As a less subjective way to asses changes in well-being, we also collected
 data on consumption.
 We found very little difference between the treatment and control groups,
 which is also reflected in the index depicted in Figure

Household level effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we know that our videos are able to change knowledge, adoption
 and production if we aggregate at the household level, we discard the control
 group and start looking at the gender related design attributes of the
 video-enabled information campaign.
 We start by looking at the recipient attribute and test whether reducing
 intra-household information asymmetries leads to different outcomes.
 This is done by comparing the average of outcomes in households where the
 video was shown to both co-heads to the average of outcomes in households
 where the information was given to only one of the spouses.
 Note that also here, we do not care about which of the three videos was
 shown (the one where the man provides the information, the one where the
 woman provides the information or the one where the information is provided
 by a couple) and so we can use all the information: 1,053 households where
 the couple was shown a video can be compared to 2,647 households where
 either a man or woman was shown the video
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As explained in Footnote

, we also estimate the difference here using a regression to be able to
 control for the orthogonal factor.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we expect changes in gender related design attributes to affect mostly
 inclusiveness, we look at gender disagregated outcomes.
 We differentiate between outcomes pertaining to the man, outcomes pertaining
 to the woman and outcomes associated with the couple as a single unit.
 However, for each of the outcomes, the definition of what pertains to male,
 female and joint differs somewhat.
 For knowledge, male knowledge refers to instances where the male co-head
 is able to answer correctly on the questions.
 Similarly, female knowledge means that the woman co-head is able to answer
 correctly.
 Joint knowledge refers to instances where both male and female co-head
 provided the correct answer
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that this differs from what was defined as household level knowledge
 in the previous section, which was defined as either one of the co-heads
 knowing the correct answer to a question.
\end_layout

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to collecting data on the adoption of 10 technologies and practices
 at the plot level, we also inquired about decision making related to these
 10 technologies and practices.
 For example, we asked who decided about the timing of the first weeding,
 who made the decisions related to soil fertility management, who decided
 about plant spacing and seed rates, etc.
 These activities could either be decided upon unilateral by the male co-head,
 unilaterally by the female co-head, or jointly by the male and female co-heads.
 We then go one step further and also check if, conditional on who made
 the decision, the technology or practice that was promoted in the video
 was implemented.
 As such, male adoption is an index that is based on the adoption of a range
 of technologies and practices on plots where the man made the decision
 related to that particular technology (for example, a case where a man
 indicates he alone decided on the spacing and seed rate to use and the
 recommended spacing of 75cm x 30cm with 1 plant per hill was used).
 Similarly, female adoption is an index that is based on the adoption of
 a range of technologies and practices on plots where the woman made the
 decision related to that particular technology.
 Joint adoption is an index that is based on the adoption of a range of
 technologies and practices on plots where the decision related to that
 particular technology was taken jointly by the male and female co-head.
 Finally, we also look at productivity, separately for plots managed by
 men, plots managed by women, and jointly managed plots.

 shows results for the difference in outcomes for the subgroup of households
 where the information was targeted to the couple and outcomes were the
 information was provided to an individual within the household (either
 man or woman).
 We again rely on indices that summarize families of outcomes.
 If co-heads monopolize information they receive, we would expect male knowledge
 to be lower in the group of households where only one of the spouses received
 the information than in the group where both co-heads were provided the
 information.
 The same holds for female knowledge.
 We would also expect that the likelihood that both co-heads answer correctly
 is significantly higher if intra-household information asymmetries are
 eliminated.
 The fact that we do not see significant differences between the two groups
 means that, to some extent, household co-heads share information among
 themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Showing the video to both co-heads instead of only one significantly affects
 decision making on plot management.
 In particular, we see that showing the video to both co-heads reduces unilatera
l decision making and increases joint decision making.
 Furthermore, we find that showing the video to both co-heads instead of
 to only one leads to significantly more adoption of the technologies and
 practices that are promoted in the video under joint management

.
 According to the production index, we also find a positive impact of showing
 the video to both co-heads.
 However, the production effect from reducing information asymmetries seems
 to be more in the extensive margin, with a 10 percent increase in production
 and an 11 percent increase in area under cultivation.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Empowering women with information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now look at the effect of empowering women with information by including
 her as a recipient of the agricultural extension information.
 Referring back to the experimental design in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Experimental-Design"

\end_inset

, this can be tested by comparing average outcomes in households where the
 information was given to a woman alone or to a woman as part of a couple
 to average outcomes in households where the information was given to a
 man alone (as would be the 
\emph on
de facto
\emph default
 case in many extension advisory services today).
 As above, the factorial design means we can use all the information from
 the 9 treatment cells and compare 2,192 households where a woman was involved
 as a recipient to 1,139 households in which only the man was targeted
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In addition to account for the different number of observations in different
 cells by controlling for the orthogonal factor in a regression framework
 as explained in Footnote 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fn:The-experiment-was"

\end_inset

, we now also have different group sizes for the groups that we pool to
 test the hypothesis.
 In particular, we have 1,139 households where the woman alone was shown
 a video and 1,053 households where a video was shown to the couple, leading
 to a higher weight of the outcome of the former group in the average outcome.
 To deal with this, we will take a random sample of the larger groups to
 make them equal in size to the smallest group.
 In this particular case, we thus take a random sample of 1,053 households
 from the 1,139 households where the woman alone saw a video to make sure
 observations are balanced between the two subgroups within the

Not surprisingly, we find that involving women as the recipient of information
 increases their knowledge.
 Also, male knowledge reduces, as half of the women involved treatment group
 consists of households where the man did not receive any information.
 What is more surprisingly, however, is the fact that joint knowledge does
 not increase.
 The fact that joint knowledge is not different between the two groups is
 caused by the fact that men seem to learn less when information is targeted
 to the couple then when this same information is targeted to men individually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empowering effect of involving women as recipients of information is
 clearly demonstrated when we look at decision making.
 Empowering women with information leads to more decision being made by
 the woman co-head alone, and reduces male unilateral decision making.
 Also here, there is no impact of involving women on joint decision making.
 Not only do women decide more, they also apply what is promoted in the
 videos: We find that, in a household where the female co-head was involved
 as a recipient of the information campaign, the score on the index for
 adoption under female management is about 0.15 standard deviations higher
 than in the average household where the video was shown to only the male
 co-head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the increased adoption under women management does not translate
 into higher productivity under women management.
 Involving women does, however, reduce productivity under male management.
 This may be because women tend to adopt technologies and practices that
 require less pecuniary resources such as weeding, while men may have more
 access to more expensive technologies such as inorganic fertilizer.
 In general, the former have a lower yield response than the latter.
 We find some indication of this in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adopt"

\end_inset

, where we look at the impact of involving women as recipients of information
 on technology adoption under female management.
 We do indeed find that effects are largest for practices such as timely
 weeding and striga management, while it is relatively low for fertilizer
 adoption or the use of improved seed.

Priming a cooperative approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now turn to the second factor in our design and investigate if changing
 the gender of the individual that provides the information affects outcomes.
 In a first hypothesis, grounded in the fact farm households are managed
 at the household level, we wonder if emphasizing a cooperative approach
 to farming in the agricultural extension information video also leads to
 more cooperation among the households that were exposed to this message.
 This can be done by comparing outcomes of households in which the version
 of the video was shown where information was given by the male and female
 co-head together acting as a couple to outcomes of households where the
 version of the version of the video was shown where information was given
 by either the male of female co-head alone.
 As the focus is now on the second factor, we can abstract from who the
 video was shown to and average over the first factor.
 As such, from Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Experimental-Design"

\end_inset

 we learn that we can compare outcomes of 1,107 households where the video
 featuring a couple was shown (to either the man alone, the woman alone,
 or to the couple) to outcomes of 2,224 households where the video featuring
 an individual (male or female) was shown (to either the man alone, the
 woman alone, or to the couple).

 For decision making and decision making and actual adoption in particular,
 the effect seems to go in the expected direction: households where a cooperativ

 and also adopt more under joint management.
 The production effect does not significantly differ form zero.

Challenging gender stereotypes

A second hypothesis we test using the messenger factor is related to challenging
 gender stereotypes.
 As mentioned above, maize cultivation is regarded as a maize business in
 Uganda, and we test if showing women that participate in maize cultivation
 in our video leads to increased participation of women.
 To do so, we compare outcomes of the 2,219 households that were shown a
 version of the video where a women was involved in providing the information
 (either alone or as part of a couple) to outcomes of the 1,112 households
 that were shown the video where a man alone was giving all the information

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 as part of the couple treatment by taking a random sample of the former
 group.

Challenging gender stereotypes does not seem to affect knowledge.
 However, we do find that involving a women as a messenger significantly
 reduces male unilateral decision making as compared to instance where the
 information is provided by the man alone.
 It also reduce actual adoption under male management.
 We also find some evidence that challenging gender stereotypes in this
 way leads to higher production under female management.
 The fact that we find no effect of the intervention on adoption under female
 management suggests that the effect on production works through different
 pathways.
 For instance, challenging gender stereotypes may encourage women to exert
 more effort, leading to higher production outcomes.

Gender homophily effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we exploit the interaction of the two gender related factors to
 test gender homophily effects in agricultural extension.
 In particular, we test if outcomes are different if the gender of the person
 that receives the information is the same as the gender of the person that
 gives the information.
 Referring again to Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Experimental-Design"

\end_inset

, we discard the 1,053 households that received the information as a couple,
 as well as the 1,107 households that viewed the version of the video where
 a couple provided the information, leaving us with 1540 observations.
 To test the homophily hypothesis, we compare outcome of 770 households
 where the gender of the recipient matches the gender of the messenger (385
 households where the messenger is a man and the recipient is the male co-head
 + 385 households where the messenger is a woman and the recipient is the
 female co-head) to the outcomes of 770 households where the gender of the
 recipient differs from the gender of the messenger (385 households where
 the messenger is a man and the recipient is the female co-head + 385 households
 where the messenger is a woman and the recipient is the male co-head).

).
 It also does not seem to affect decision making.
 However, we do find that if women receive information from women, they
 are more likely to adopt the technologies and practices on the plots they
 manage.
 Also here, however, the increased adoption under female management does
 not translate into increased production under female management.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a world characterized by incomplete and asymmetric information, and intra-hou
sehold gender related constraints to efficiency, targeted efforts to fill
 knowledge gaps can make a big difference

.
 However, not every information campaign is equally effective nor inclusive,
 and often, seemingly small attributes, such as the way it is delivered,
 who is targeted by the message and who delivers the message, can result
 in significant differences in impact at the household and intra-household
 level.
 Understanding and quantifying the importance of each of these design attributes
 through rigorous evaluation research should therefore be an essential part
 of any knowledge exchange model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Motivated by the observation that most agricultural extension advisory services
 are biased toward men, this study assesses the impact of two gender-related
 attributes of a generic agricultural extension information campaign.
 The first attribute is related to the gender of the person (or gender compositi
on of the persons) that provide the information.
 The second attribute pertains to the gender of the person (or gender compositio
n of the persons) to whom the information is targeted.
 Taken together, these two attributes enable us to test various of hypotheses
 toughing upon intra-household information asymmetries and bargaining power,
 cooperative approaches to farming, gender stereotypes in agriculture, and
 gender homophily effects in extension advisory systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The various hypotheses are tested using a field experiment where the messenger
 of the information and the recipient of the information is randomly altered
 according to a 3 by 3 factorial design.
 The study population was maize farm households in Eastern Uganda, from
 which we sampled about 3,600 couples.
 These farmers were shown a video according to the treatment group they
 were randomly assigned to.
 The videos showed how modern technologies and improved agronomic practices
 can be used to increase production.
 The messages were packaged in an attractive and accessible manner, and
 featured role-model farmers explaining how intensification of maize production
 improved their lives.
 The videos were shown twice, once just before the planting season, and
 once during planting stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first checked if the information intervention works, by comparing household
 level outcomes of households that were shown the agricultural extension
 information video to outcomes of households that were allocated to a placebo
 treatment.
 We found that as a result of being shown the video, farmers had experienced
 improvements in several key knowledge outcomes.
 As a result of being shown the video, farmers also adopted a range of recommend
ed practices.
 As a result of having been shown a video, households reduced the area under
 maize cultivation while producing the same amount, leading to a significant
 increase in maize yields, from 428 kg/acre to 488 kg/acre.
 We found no effect on self-assessed well-being, nor on consumption expenditures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then turned to the analysis of the gender attributes.
 We found that reducing information asymmetries, by making sure both household
 co-heads receive the same information, did not affect knowledge, indicating
 information was to some extent shared between spouses.
 We also found targeting both spouses in information campaigns increased
 joint decision making, joint adoption and joint production.
 Furthermore, we found that arming women with information led to increased
 knowledge of women, more decision-making by women and more adoption under
 female management than when information is targeted to the man only within
 the household.
 However, we did not find an impact on production under female management,
 suggesting women are constrained by production factors other than only
 knowledge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also test if priming a cooperative approach to farming encourages spouses
 to work more together.
 We find that showing a video where a couple explains how to be a successful
 maize farmer indeed leads spouses to increase joint decision making and
 joint adoption.
 We also attempted to challenge the prevailing view that maize farming is
 a male business by showing videos that involve women in maize farming.
 We found that this reduced the likelihood that men decided, and adopt,
 unilaterally.
 Finally, we found that homophily effects related to gender seem to exist
 in agricultural extension as women tended to adopt more modern technologies
 and practices on their plots when they were informed by a fellow woman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study thus showed that a low cost, scalable agricultural information
 campaign using video can have an important effect on knowledge, adoption
 behavior and farm management, and ultimately production.
 It further underscores the importance of paying close attention to the
 various design features of such an information campaign.
 We looked at the importance of only two gender related features (messenger
 and recipient) and found this to be relevant for effectiveness and inclusivity.
 This finding thus suggest other design features may be equally, if not
 more important.
 Therefore, future research on other design features, such as the effect
 of the way the information is packaged or framed, may provide invaluable
 in designing effective and inclusive agricultural extension advisory services.
