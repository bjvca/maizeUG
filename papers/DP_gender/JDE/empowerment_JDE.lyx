\begin_layout Abstract
Programs designed to increase well-being among low-income households generally
 include an information provision component.
 Often, these components ignore complex dynamics that govern intra-household
 decision-making.
 In the context of agricultural extension provision in Uganda—where male
 targeting bias is common and female extension experts and model farmers
 are rare—we conduct a field experiment among maize farmers to examine how
 gendered information campaigns affect women’s agency and achievements.
 In one treatment, we investigate the effect of targeting women within household
s, either alone or as part of the couple.
 In a second treatment, we explore exposure to female role models.
 We find that targeting women with information increases their agency, access
 to resources, and achievements in farming.
 Featuring women as role models in information campaigns may be useful in
 reducing men’s dominance in the domain of agriculture, and therefore can
 create opportunities for greater involvement of women.

Women have limited ability to make strategic choices that are important
 to live the life they value, and to transform these choices into desired
 action and outcomes

literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This lack of agency manifests itself in a variety of contexts but is particular
ly in many developing countries.
 For instance, while women bare the brunt of child care, their voice in
 deciding how many children to bear is often limited

key "10.1257/aer.104.7.2210"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 In a number of low income countries, nearly fifty percent of adult women
 are restricted in their movement, lack control over resources, are married
 as a child, condone or have suffered intimate partner violence, and cannot
 ask for the use of a condom

.
 Partly as a result of this lack of decision-making power, women are also
 often constrained in their achievements.
 In low- and middle income countries in particular, women's labor force
 participation is generally lower then men's and women receive significantly
 lower wages for similar work

 In societies with son-biased fertility preferences, mothers breastfeed
 girls less than boys and provide greater care for boys, with consequences
 for daugthers' survival rates, their long-run health effect, and broader
 demographic inequalities

\begin_layout Standard
There are various factors that limit women's agency and achievements.
 Some are linked to gendered economic inequalities in access to resources,
 for example, ownership and use-rights over land or capital owned by a household
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 These inequalities may be further exacerbated by asymmetric access to informati
on between spouses in a household, as women who are informationally disadvantage
d have been empirically shown to affect intra-household allocations of assets,
 income, and consumption goods, or access to health and education services,
 and other resources

 Strong gendered norms and institutions often perpetuate these inequalities,

Research suggests that programs that target women with information may be
 an important route to increasing women's empowerment.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "10.1257/app.20170416"

\end_inset

 find that the share of girls reporting sex against their will dropped by
 close to a third as a result of providing them with, inter alia, information
 on sex, reproduction, and marriage.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "10.1257/app.3.1.1"

\end_inset

 finds that providing new information to adolescent girls—that older men
 are more likely to be infected with HIV—reduced sex with older men.
 But while emphasis is often placed on selecting who to target information
 to, less emphasis is typically placed on selecting who should provide the
 information.
 Yet studies show that information may be more credible if it comes from
 an official source 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "eg."
key "10.1257/app.5.1.104"

\end_inset

, or if the recipient of the information can identify with the person or
 persons who provide the information 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.415"

\end_inset

.
 The combination of peer effects and gender homophily effects, where individuals
 learn from similar individuals of the same gender, may be particularly
 important in the context of information campaigns to promote women's empowermen
t.
 This is highlighted in several recent studies on the influence of role
 models, which suggest important non-cognitive impact pathways that can
 be instrumental to information campaigns.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 show that successful role models can increase entry into traditionally
 male-dominated sectors.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 show that role models not only affect the behavior of those that identify
 with the model, but also influence the behavior of others in situations
 where women are constrained by relationships and social norms.
 Furthermore, role models may facilitate shifts in social norms: 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 shows how reductions in fertility result from television soap operas portraying
 small families.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gendered dimensions of information campaigns such as targeting information
 to women or presenting women as role models are particularly relevant in
 developing-country agriculture, where smallholder production systems are
 typically characterized by strong social norms that marginalize women in
 productive decision-making processes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.2307/24582373"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 In these systems, women typically work long days in the field, yet have
 little voice in deciding what crops to grow, which technologies and inputs
 to use, and how much of the output to allocate to home consumption or sale
 in markets

.
 Yet, in addition to its intrinsic value, there are many well-established
 benefits to empowering women farmers in developing countries.
 A more prominent role for women in the farm household has been shown to
 result in more efficient intra-household allocations of scarce resources,
 more equitable distribution of the risks and returns to investments in
 household production, and general improvements in welfare and poverty

 Involving women in the choice of which crops to cultivate may also lead
 to better dietary and nutritional outcomes at the household level

\begin_layout Standard
One constraint to realizing such outcomes is the presence of asymmetric
 information between spouses, with women having less information on a range
 of productivity-enhancing technologies, inputs, and practices.
 The fact that women possess less knowledge than their male spouses necessarily
 limits their participation in decision-making on agricultural production
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In many contexts, men rarely discuss agronomic practices or crop management
 choices with their wives or female partners 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "magnan2015information,FISHER201582"

Reducing womens' information disadvantage by targeting women with information
 may thus be empowering, particularly if the information is presented in
 an appealing manner.
 For instance,

 show that male and female farmers in Malawi learn and retain information
 about the new technology equally well, with women applying it on their
 own farm more often than their male counterparts.
 In Uganda,

 innovations in banana cultivation as men in male-headed households if they
 were as knowledgeable about the technology.
\end_layout

There are also reasons to believe that the source of information may be
 important for women's empowerment in agriculture.
 Peer effects have been found important in learning about new technologies
 or practices

 find that social identity of the person that provides extension information
 influences others’ learning and adoption, as farmers appear most convinced
 by communicators who share a group identity with them, or who face agricultural
 conditions most comparable to themselves.
 In Mozambique, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 find that women’s awareness of pit planting farming techniques increased
 by 9 percentage points and adoption of the technology by 5 percentage points
 in communities where they trained female messengers on sustainable land
 management techniques.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In smallholder agriculture systems in developing countries, information
 related to productivity-enhancing technologies, inputs, and practices is
 generally disseminated though public extension services.
 However, agricultural extension services are typically biased toward men,
 with information targeted mainly to male members of a farm-household and
 in formats that are rarely tailored to women.
 In Malawi, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BENYISHAY2020102380"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 find that women who provided information about a new maize farming technology
 were perceived to be less knowledgeable both by male and female maize farmers,
 while, objectively, they were not.
 These perceptions are both pervasive and influential, deepening the male
 bias in extension systems.
 In Uganda, a recent survey on public service delivery found that only 16
 percent of extension agents are women 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kabunga2016state"

\end_inset

.
 This suggests that extension systems do not sufficiently recognize the
 gendered power dynamics governing intra-household information exchanges,
 thus reinforcing the dis-empowerment of women in agricultural decision-making
 processes

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we examine ways in which information and communication technology
 (ICT) applications used in agricultural extension services can be designed
 to increase women’s access to informational resources, their agency, and
 their achievements in farming, all of which directly relate to women’s
 empowerment in agriculture.
 We conduct a field experiment among 3,330 maize-farming households in eastern
 Uganda to test the effectiveness of including women as recipients of informatio
n, and of exposure to female role models.
 To test the effectiveness of targeting women with information, we compare
 outcomes of households where the female co-head was included in the target
 audience to outcomes of households where information was targeted to the
 male co-head alone.
 To test if exposure to female role models is effective, we compare outcomes
 of households where a women was included in the dissemination of the informatio
n to outcomes of households where the information is provided exclusively
 by a man.
 Our study design, which takes the form of a factorial experiment with 3
 levels in each of the two factors, allows us to further explore some of
 the mechanisms, such as the role of private access to information, the
 effect of reductions in information asymmetry within the household, of
 importance of peer effects and gender homophily effects, and the impact
 of challenging gendered norms and stereotypes among both women and men.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information intervention is implemented as a set of short videos that
 provides viewers with information and recommendations on appropriate input
 use, management practices, and investment strategies that can be followed
 to obtain higher maize yields.
 To test the impact of information effects on women's empowerment, we vary
 who is targeted within the household by randomly assigning household members—th
e male co-head alone, the female co-head alone, or both co-heads together—to
 the video screenings.
 To test the impact of role model, peer, and gender homophily effects on
 women's empowerment, we randomly assigned farmers to screenings of three
 different versions of the video: one featuring a male actor, another featuring
 a female actor, and a third featuring both actors together, holding constant
 all other information contained in the video.
 The videos were screened with study participants at their homes using tablet
 computers, and were screened twice during the course of the field experiment:
 once before the start of the agricultural season and once at the time of
 planting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empowerment impacts of information provision are fairly straightforward
 in our experiment.
 We find that targeting women within the household (as opposed to only targeting
 the male co-head) with information had a positive effect on different domains
 of empowerment, including women’s knowledge of agronomic practices, their
 participation in agricultural decision-making, and their adoption of recommende
d practices and inputs.
 Most of the effects were driven by the subsample of women who received
 the information alone, suggesting that both male and female co-heads tend
 to monopolize information or engage in only very limited intra-household
 information sharing.
 While there is some evidence that the subsample of women who received informati
on jointly with their husbands increased joint decision-making, these effects
 are much weaker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empowerment impacts of involving women as messengers are more complicated.
 While we find no effect on women’s knowledge, decision-making, or adoption
 of recommended agronomic practices, we do find that involving women as
 messengers may lead to an increase in the use of organic fertilizer by
 women.
 Looking only at households where women co-heads were targeted, we find
 that if these women were shown a video featuring a woman, they were more
 likely to make decisions than if they were shown a video in which a man
 provided the information.
 This suggests the presence of peer or gender homophily effects.
 Furthermore, if we consider only households where male co-heads were targeted,
 we find that if these men were shown a video featuring a woman, they were
 less likely to make decisions unilaterally, suggesting that presence of
 role incongruity effects that result from challenging widely held beliefs
 and stereotypes about women being less able to make decisions related to
 agriculture.

\begin_layout Standard
This section offers a review of related literature on gender and agriculture
 with specific emphasis on the gendered dimensions of access to information
 within the household and role models, drawing on examples that highlight
 their influence on extension service provision and technology adoption.
 Throughout the study, we define empowerment as a process where those (women)
 who were previously denied the ability to make and act upon important choices
 in their lives gain such ability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1111/1467-7660.00125"

\end_inset

.
 This ability to make choices is based on three main components: access
 to resources (including material assets, informational resources, and social
 capital); agency (a person’s ability to act on their decisions); and achievemen
t (the social and economic outcomes such as income and well-being).
 Women’s empowerment can imply that women have greater ability to make and
 act upon choices both individually, or jointly with their male co-head

Information Constraints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is ample evidence that women face information deficiencies and asymmetries
 relative to men in a range of circumstances, and thus may hold weaker bargainin
g positions.
 In agriculture, women farmers have been shown to be more deprived of informatio
n regarding good agronomic practices 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1111/j.1574-0862.2001.tb00233.x,DOSS20012075,10.1093/erae/jbv039"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 In certain situations, this may be directly linked to unequal access to
 agricultural extension and advisory services between men and women farmers
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "NDIRITU2014117"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This unequal access may contribute to lower adoption rates of improved
 agricultural practices and technologies among women.
 For example, studies show that with equal access to extension services,
 land, and labor, men and women farmers in male-headed households in Ghana
 would be as likely to adopt modern agronomic practices 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Women’s access to information—specifically, to information provided by agricultu
ral extension services—may be subject to both extra-household and intra-househol
d constraints.
 The extra-household constraints can be infrastructural and logistic, such
 as for instance women not being targeted, women lacking the money to travel
 to extension training locations, or women lacking the time to attend because
 of household management, domestic and reproductive responsibilities 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "FLETSCHNER20111422,wodon2006gender"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Extra-household constraints may also exist in terms of information content
 or delivery: it may not be adapted to women’s interests or needs, or may
 not recognize women’s role as agricultural producers, and therefore may
 not appeal to women.
 Human capital constraints may also play a role given women’s generally
 lower levels of education in many rural contexts in developing countries.
 Norms limiting women’s mobility and women’s interaction with men may impose
 additional constraints 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "FLETSCHNER20111422"

\end_inset

.
 These extra-household constraints to women’s access to information mean
 that, in many situations, women may rely more on informal networks for
 gathering information.
 When these networks are gender-specific and gender-segregated, problems
 associated with asymmetric information persist

\begin_layout Standard
A (married) woman’s interaction with her husband may often be her main (intra-ho
usehold) source of information on agriculture.
 This assumption is implicit in most extension strategies that target the
 male household head 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "FLETSCHNER20111422"

 Yet the assumption requires that preferences of male and female co-heads
 within a household align; that household resources, including information,
 are shared; and that households cooperate to reach Pareto-optimal outcomes.
 However, the conceptualization of the agricultural household as a unit
 with such properties has been challenged in theoretical work

 Role models can affect women's empowerment directly: as women start questioning

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We explore cognitive and socio-psychological dimensions of extension information
 campaigns on various dimensions of women’s empowerment.
 We consider women’s empowerment along the lines of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "JOHNSON2016295"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, where empowerment encompasses both an increase in women’s individual and
 joint decision-making within the household with respect to a set of key
 livelihood-related variables.
 We thus assess empowerment as a positive change both for the female co-head
 individually and for the female and male co-heads jointly in each to the
 following spheres: their knowledge about recommended agronomic practices
 and inputs; their participation in intra-household decision-making on farm
 production; the choices they make about the adoption of recommended practices
 and the use of inputs; the output and yield from plots; and their participation
 in selling farm output.
 A reduction in male domination over these different dimensions is considered
 empowering as well.
 In the context of our study, these variables are specific to the types
 of smallholders defined by our population of interest (and described in
 detail below), but are likely to be relevant for other smallholder agricultural
 contexts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a first hypothesis, we test if involving women in receiving extension
 information strengthens women’s knowledge about recommended practices and
 inputs, and possibly makes common knowledge about other agronomic practices
 more salient.
 There are different ways in which (also) targeting women with information
 may lead to these outcomes.
 The first assumes that information that would otherwise be, to some extent,
 monopolized by the male co-head, now also reaches women.
 If the female co-head receives the information alone and does not monopolize
 that information or if both the female and male co-head of a household
 receive the information as a couple, we would expect an increase in both
 women’s individual knowledge and the couple’s overall (joint) knowledge
 where intra-household communication, consultation, and learning occur,
 which can lead to an increase in women’s individual and joint decision-making
 and outcomes.
 If the female co-head receives the information alone, she might also monopolize
 that information, in which case changes in women’s individual knowledge,
 decision-making and outcomes may be expected.
 The second channel is through a change in a woman’s bargaining position
 that results from possession of an informational asset, which may prevent
 a male co-head from advancing his preferences at the expense of hers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a second hypothesis, we test whether directly involving women in conveying
 information, thereby portraying them as (equally) qualified experts, may
 also affect women’s empowerment.
 Giving women key roles in conveying information may affect recipients of
 the information via role model effects.
 Role model effects work via learning externalities through peers and gender
 homophily effects.
 In addition, role models may also challenge role incongruity.
 Peer effects occur where information recipients can relate to the information
 messenger as a peer—as an individual with a similar identity or experience,
 or as an individual possessing credible knowledge and information.
 Gender homophily effects, a specific type of peer effects, occur where
 these peer effects are specifically based on a match in the sex of the
 messenger and recipient.
 Role incongruity effects occur where women update their beliefs about roles
 and responsibilities in the household as a result of receiving information
 from a messenger that is somehow inconsistent with their beliefs.
 We expect such effects to increase women’s aspirations about their households
 and livelihoods, thereby causing them to make more ambitious choices, in
 turn contributing to improved outcomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Role incongruity effects may also work indirectly.
 The involvement of women in conveying information may cause men to revise
 their beliefs about women’s agency and capacity to make sound investment
 decisions on the farm.
 As a result, men may leave more space for decision-making by their wife
 and relax any inhibition to their wife’s access to complementary inputs,
 their decision-making on the adoption of recommended practices, or the
 improvement of crop production.

To explore these effects, we conducted a field experiment in 2017 among
 smallholder maize-farming households in eastern Uganda.
 Participants in the field experiment were drawn from monogamous maize-cultivati

 both as a staple and as a marketable crop.
 The experiment was conducted during the second maize-growing season, which
 runs from approximately August to January of the following year, and is
 characterized by a shorter period of rainfall than the first maize-growing
 season.
 During this second season, the complete cycle from planting to harvest
 requires three to three and a half months, and farmers tend to cultivate
 early-maturing but lower yielding maize varieties.
 Fields are prepared in August, planted in September, and harvested from
 December onward.

 They did not find evidence that land quality (in terms of soil fertility
 and slope) or type of tenure differ between female- and male-managed maize
 plots.
 Decision-making power is also related to customary gender roles and responsibil

 In a first version of the video, a male actor-farmer is featured in the

During implementation of the experiment, one of these three versions of

 The videos were shown on 10-inch Android tablet computers by trained field

 Information on the sampled households and their treatment assignment was
 pre-loaded onto the tablet computers, such that the correct video was automatic
ally queued and enumerators were only able to screen the appropriate version
 of the video.
 The video was shown twice to our study participants, once before the maize

The video itself consists of a 10-minute inspirational story in which a

 how s/he used to struggle with low maize yields.
 The actor-farmer then shows what inputs s/he used and what recommended
 practices s/he followed to successfully increase his/her yields.
 The choice of what inputs and practices to promote in this video was based
 on key informant interviews conducted in May 2017 with agronomists, maize
 breeders, district agricultural officers and other government staff, extension
 workers, and maize farmers.
 The information provided in the video is also generally consistent with
 the package of recommendations promoted by the Ugandan Ministry of Agriculture,

 through the timely application of organic and inorganic fertilizers; use
 of fresh seed of improved maize varieties and hybrids; and crop management
 practices such as timely planting, optimal plant spacing, and timely weeding.
 The video also contained content on the costs and benefits of the different
 practices and inputs being promoted, and recommended that viewers take
 a long-term perspective on improving their maize cultivation by starting
 small and reinvesting profits on increasingly larger areas of land.

 To examine the impact of providing women with direct access to extension
 information on different measures of women’s empowerment, we compare outcomes
 of the 2,192 households where the female co-head was involved in watching
 the video (either alone or as part of a couple) to outcomes of the 1,139
 households where only the male co-head watched the video (Model 1).
 There are likely to be different effects from showing the video to the
 female co-head alone as compared to showing it to the female co-head as
 part of the couple, for instance related to the possibility of monopolizing
 information or gaining bargaining power on the basis of uniquely held informati

 That is why we additionally zoom in on the effect of showing the video
 to the female co-head alone versus showing it to the male co-head (Model

 versus only to the male co-head (Model 1B).

\begin_inset Formula $\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

.
 It is important to note that this is a composite parameter, denoting the
 effect of the treatment when approximately equal shares of households receive
 the orthogonal treatments.
 In factorial designs where each factor has a treatment and a control condition,
 one can run a fully interacted model.
 The main effects can then be interpreted as the effect of the treatment
 alone.
 However, in our design, we do not have strict control categories in the
 factors (at least someone needs to provide information in the video and
 at least one person in the household was shown a video).
 It is therefore more informative to estimate treatment effects that are
 weighted-averages of the interactions with other treatments.
 To continue with the example of the first hypothesis, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 thus denotes the effect of involving women in receiving information when
 one third of the sample receives this information in the form of a video
 where only a man provides the information, one third where only a women
 provides this information, and one third where the information is given
 by a couple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to controlling for the orthogonal factor 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{i}$
\end_inset

 in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ols"

\end_inset

, we need to take into account the fact that also within a factor, treatment
 cells may have a different number of observations.
 This becomes an issue when two cells are pooled.
 For example, in testing the first hypothesis, we see from figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Layout-of-experimental"

\end_inset

 that there are 1,139 households where the female co-head alone is to receive
 the information treatment, but only 1,053 households are allocated to receive
 the information treatment as a couple.
 When pooling these two groups into a single group to assess women involvement
 in receiving information, the women alone group gets a higher weight.
 We thus reweigh observations to make sure each group gets an appropriate
 weight when pooling groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use randomization inference to calculate associated p-values for the
 two-sided hypothesis of no effect.
 We aggregate families of outcomes into indices, which are constructed as
 the weighted mean of the individual standardized outcomes, using as weights
 the inverse of the co-variance matrix of the transformed outcomes

.
 Combining outcomes in indices is a common strategy to guard against over-reject
ion of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference.
 However, it may also be interesting to see the effect of the intervention
 on individual outcomes.
 An alternative strategy to deal with the multiple comparisons problem is
 to adjustment the significance levels to control the Family Wise Error
 Rates (FWER).
 We used re-randomization to construct the joint null distribution for the
 family of outcomes we are testing.
 From this family-wise sharp null, we obtained the corresponding FWER-consistent
 significance thresholds by determining which cutoffs yield 10 percent,
 five percent and one percent significant hypothesis tests across all tests
 and simulations

Data were collected from households in five districts in eastern Uganda:
 Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo, and Namutumba.
 From among these districts, we first removed town councils and two sub-counties
 that consisted of islands in Lake Victoria.
 We then used a two-stage cluster sampling approach to obtain a representative
 sample of this population.
 Specifically, we first selected parishes randomly and in proportion to
 the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all households, from which we randomly
 selected households to be included in the study.

 The average household head is about 40 years old, and in only 37 percent
 of households did the head finish primary school.
 Households are large, consisting of more than 7.6 members.
 Only 11 percent of sampled households reported having access to extension
 in the previous year.
 Few farmers use inorganic fertilizer at baseline; the use of fresh improved
 seed is higher.
 About 78 percent of households report to be owning a mobile phone.

The table also serves as a balance test for the two main comparisons we
 will make (Balance tests for the other hypothesis tests can be found in
 Appendix Tables

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

).
 We find baseline imbalance in observable characteristics that are statistically
 significant for the hypothesis related to empowering women with information
 (Model 1 in the upper panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance"

\end_inset

) and a test for joint significance of the differences confirms this imbalance
 (F-statistic = 3.40; p-value = 0.001).
 However, this apparent imbalance can be explained by the fact that the
 gender of the respondent at baseline was confounded with the treatment.
 In particular, if the woman alone was targeted as the recipient of information,
 she was the person that was interviewed.
 If the man alone would view the video, it was the man who responded.
 In cases where the couple was targeted, both spouses were present during
 baseline interview.
 The significant differences are thus likely the result of spousal disagreement
 in survey data that has been documented in a variety of settings

 This is consistent with the fact that we do find balance on characteristics
 that are easier to verify by the enumerator, such as the material of the
 wall of the house or the distance to the nearest input provider.
 For the comparison to test the impact of role model effects, we do not
 find imbalance between the groups (lower panel in Table

Indicator Definition

\begin_layout Standard
This study aims to estimate effects on women’s empowerment.
 We consider a woman as ‘empowered’ not only if she decides or achieves
 things on her own, but also if she does so in partnership with the male
 co-head in the household.
 Thus, we examine effects on both women’s outcomes and outcomes that are
 shared (joint) between the female and male co-heads of household.
 Those outcomes are cast as increases in (a) the female co-head’s knowledge
 (individually and/or jointly with her male co-head) about the information
 promoted in the video or re-activated by it; (b) the extent to which maize
 production decisions in the household are taken by the female co-head alone
 and/or jointly with her male co-head; (c) the adoption of the recommended
 practices and inputs decided upon by the female co-head individually and/or
 jointly with her male co-head; (d) output and yield on maize plots that
 were female-managed and/or jointly managed; and (e) maize sales decided
 upon by the female co-head individually or jointly with her male co-head.
 Additionally, we will examine effects on men’s outcomes assuming that a
 reduction of men’s individual decision-making and adoption can be empowering
 for women as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowledge about four different practices recommended in the video is measured
 by the extent to which respondents answered correctly to multiple choice
 questions about the practices.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
First, respondents are considered knowledgeable about plant spacing if they
 correctly answered that the best spacing is two and a half feet between
 rows and one foot between plants, with one seed per hill.
 Second, respondents are considered knowledgeable about combining practices
 if they correctly answered they would allocate 40,000 Ugandan shillings
 to buy improved seed and fertilizer, as combining inputs is a better strategy
 than putting all the eggs in one basket.
 Third, respondents are considered knowledgeable about optimal weeding if
 they correctly answered weeding is most important during the first four
 weeks after planting.
 Fourth, respondents are considered knowledgeable about fall armyworm control
 if they correctly answered that spraying in the evening is most effective
 since fall armyworm eats during night.
 The information needed to correctly answer the first three questions was
 provided in the videos.
 The videos did not provide information on fall armyworm control, hence
 no effect was expected for this question.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 A woman’s (man’s) knowledge score is based on responses from the female
 (male) co-head; the joint knowledge score is based on responses from both
 the female and male co-heads, where it was considered a correct joint answer
 if both of them got the answer correct, otherwise, not.
 We combine the outcomes of the four knowledge questions into a Women’s
 Knowledge Index, a Joint Knowledge Index and a Men’s Knowledge Index as
 mentioned in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Estimation"

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agricultural decision-making is based on the woman’s answers about whether
 she made a series of decisions related to household maize production.
 We differentiate between decisions made individually by the female co-head
 and decisions made jointly with her spouse.
 As women's empowerment may also lead to a reduction in unilateral decision
 making by the male co-head, we also consider decisions that, according
 to the female co-head, were decided by the man without consulting her.
 For each maize plot within the household, we thus recorded if the following
 decisions were made by the female co-head, jointly or by the male co-head:
 whether to plant maize on the plot; when to start planting the maize on
 the plot; what spacing of maize plants to use and how many maize seeds
 per hill to plant on the plot; what strategies to use to control striga
 on the plot; and when to start weeding on the plot.
 To aggregate this at the household level, we consider the proportion of
 maize plots within the household on which the female co-head reported that
 she made the decision alone, that the decision was taken jointly with her
 husband, or that her husband took the decision alone.
 Following a similar procedure as discussed above, we constructed a Women’s
 Decision-making Index, based on the proportion of the household’s maize
 plots for which the female co-head made the decisions described above alone.
 We also make indices for joint decision making and for male unilateral
 decision making.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decision making is central to women's empowerment.
 However, we may also want to check if the practices and inputs that were
 recommended in the video were also implemented on the plots.
 For instance, it may be that, due to the video, women gain voice in the
 decision making process, but if additional investments are needed (for
 instance in terms of labour time or inputs), they may still be constrained
 and decide to use a second best technology.
 We thus also consider the proportion of the household’s maize plots for
 which the female co-head decided about a particular practice alone and
 adopted the practice that was recommended in the video.
 Similarly, we consider the proportion of the household’s maize plots for
 which the female and male co-head decided and adopted a recommended practice
 jointly, as well as the proportion of household's maize plots for which
 the male co-head decided unilaterally and adopted the practice that was
 promoted in the video.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is important to note that our intervention may change both the likelihood
 that a spouse makes a decision as well as the likelihood that the decision
 maker then adopts what was recommended in the video.
 As both events are not independent, this means that the joint likelihood
 we estimate corresponds to the conditional probability that a recommended
 practice is adopted by the woman multiplied by the probability that that
 the woman makes a decision on the practice.
 This should be kept in mind when comparing effects of adoption to effects
 of decision making.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We measure adoption of the following practices as recommended in the video:
 planting within one day after the start of the rain, using the recommended
 spacing and number of seeds per hill, removing striga before it flowers,
 and doing the first weeding in the third week after planting.
 As before, we use the same method to construct a Women’s Adoption Index,
 a Joint Adoption Index and a Men’s Adoption index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We measure use of inputs such as DAP (
\emph on
Diammonium phosphate
\emph default
), urea, organic fertilizer, maize hybrids, and open pollinated varieties
 (OPVs).
 Similar to adoption of recommended practices, we consider the proportion
 of the household’s maize plots for which a particular input was used and
 this was decided individually by the female co-head.
 Similar outcomes for input adoption were constructed for joint input adoption
 and for unilateral adoption by the male co-head.
 Also here, adoption of different inputs is aggregated in a Women’s Input
 Use Index, a Joint Input Use Index, and a Men’s Input Use Index respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we measured outcomes related to production, area of production, and
 productivity on maize plots under female and joint management.
 Female (jointly) managed plots are defined as plots on which, according
 to female co-head respondents, female co-heads alone (jointly) took at
 least three out of five decisions.
 We use the total amount of maize produced on female-managed maize plots
 within the household as our measure of production.
 The area of production is the total area (in acres) of female-managed maize
 plots in the household.
 Yield (in kg per acre) is the total amount of maize produced on female-managed
 plots divided by the total area of the female-managed maize plots in the
 household.
 A secondary, more subjective indicator for yield effects is an indicator
 variable that takes the value of one if the female co-head indicates if
 the yield on at least one of the maize plots under her management was greater
 than in a normal year.
 To capture the change in women’s control over total household maize production,
 we measure both the share of household maize production that was produced
 on female-managed maize plots and the share of household acreage under
 maize cultivation that is female-managed.
 We also defined similar indicators for jointly managed plots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at maize sales as an outcome.
 A first indicator takes the value of one if any amount of the maize produced
 in the household was reported by the female co-head respondent to have
 been sold independently by the female co-head (respectively, jointly and
 independently by the male co-head).
 Selling independently by the female (male) co-head means all decisions
 regarding quantity, price and to whom the maize was sold were taken by
 the female (male) co-head according to the female co-head respondent.
 Jointly means all those decisions were taken together by the female and
 male co-head together.
 A second indicator is the amount of maize (in bags of about 100 kg) that
 the female co-head respondent reported to have sold independently (jointly/inde
pendently by the male co-head).
 For the first indicator of the likelihood of selling independently we assumed
 women did not sell any maize independently if they did not know the amount
 sold independently.
 For the second indicator (amount of maize sold independently), we only
 considered non-zero positive amounts of maize sold independently.

.
 As mentioned above, we consider results for female co-head alone, for male
 and female co-head jointly as a couple, and for male co-heads alone.
 We look at the changes in knowledge, decision making, adoption of recommended
 practices and input use, production, and sales.
 Together, this means a large number of results have to be presented, so
 a fairly rigid structure is adopted.
 In the next section (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) we summarize and interpret the most important findings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Knowledge of Recommended Practices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin our discussion of results by examining women’s knowledge outcomes,
 focusing on the knowledge index described earlier as well as the individual
 recommended practices that respondents answered questions about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we examine whether involving women as recipients of information leads
 to an increase in their knowledge (Model 1 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

).
 We do this by comparing knowledge of women in households in which female
 co-heads received the information, either alone or with their male spouse,
 to knowledge of women in households in which only the male co-head received
 the information.
 Results are reported in the upper panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowlege"

\end_inset

.
 Results show involving women as recipients of information leads to an overall
 positive and statistically significant increase women’s knowledge as judged
 by the index.
 This is driven by a positive and significant treatment effect of involving
 women as recipients of information on women’s knowledge about adequate
 spacing and the number of maize seeds per hill, and about the importance
 of combining inputs.
 Knowledge about the former increased by 7 percentage points (pp), essentially
 doubling women's knowledge on this topic.
 We observe a 5 pp increase in women’s knowledge about combining inputs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Appendix, we also report results for comparisons between households
 in which the female co-head received the information alone and households
 in which the male co-head received the information alone (model 1A in in
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

).
 Results for this comparison, reported in the top panel in Appendix Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:know_women_model1AB"

\end_inset

, show similar increase in knowledge.
 Also in the Appendix, we report results for comparisons between households
 in which the female and male co-heads together as a couple received the
 information and households in which the male co-head received the information
 alone (model 1B in in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

).
 Results for this comparison, reported in the lower panel in Appendix Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:know_women_model1AB"

\end_inset

.
 Also for this comparison, the increase in knowledge is similar to the one
 reported in the top panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowlege"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, we examine the knowledge outcomes that result from variation in
 the provider of information, as in model 2 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

.
 We examine results for role-model effects by comparing women’s knowledge
 outcomes in households that were shown the video in which a female actor
 in the video provides information (whether alone or with a male co-actor),
 to women's knowledge outcomes in households that were shown the video in
 which only a male actor provides information.
 Results, reported in the lower panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowlege"

\end_inset

, show no evidence of a generalized role-model effect: we observe no change
 in women’s knowledge outcomes as a result of involving female actors in
 the provision of information.
 Restricting the sample to households where only women were shown the video
 (as in model 2A in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

) does not change this conclusion.
 Results for this are reported in the top panel in of Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:know_women_model2AB"

\end_inset

.
 Restricting the sample to households where only men were shown the video
 (as in model 2B in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

) also does not change this conclusion (bottom panel in Appendix Table

Third, we examine joint knowledge outcomes, and present results in terms

 Results are reported in Table

 for model 1 (top panel) and model 2 (bottom panel).
 Neither reducing female knowledge deficiencies nor female role models seem
 to affect joint knowledge outcomes.
 There is some indication that new information (about spacing) received
 by female co-heads alone (as in model 1A in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

) is somewhat less likely to be passed on to their spouses than when male
 co-heads received the information, which is evident from the negative treatment
 effect of –2.6 pp on joint knowledge (reported in top panel in Appendix
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:know_joint_model1AB"

\end_inset

).
 However, the difference becomes insignificant after controlling FWER.

 Men's knowledge index, and particularly his knowledge of new information

 negatively affected by involving women in receiving information (top panel

\begin_layout Subsection
Decision-making about Maize Production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we explore the effect of the treatments on decision-making related
 to maize production within the household.
 We do this by first examining whether involving women as information recipients
 (alone or as part of a couple) results in an increase in their participation
 in decisions about maize production on an average plot managed by the household
 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

, Model 1).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:decision_main"

\end_inset

, top panel) show a positive and statistically significant treatment effect
 of 0.13 on the women’s decision-making index.
 The results are also evident across all of the decisions, where low mean
 values in the control group suggest high percent increases in women’s decision-
making.
 Comparing the group in which the female co-head received the information
 alone versus the male co-head alone (as in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

, Model 1A) shows a larger positive effect on the women’s decision-making
 index of 0.22 (Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:decide_women_model1AB"

\end_inset

, top panel).
 No such increase is found when the treatment group is restricted to the
 group in which female co-heads received the information together with their
 male spouse (as in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

, Model 1B; results in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:decide_women_model1AB"

\end_inset

, bottom panel).
 The gains in women’s individual decision-making are thus largely driven
 by exclusively targeting female co-heads with information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the lower panel of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:decision_main"

\end_inset

, we explore decision-making outcomes that result from variations in the
 information provider (illustrated in Model 2 of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

).
 Results show no evidence of a generalized role-model effect on women’s
 decision-making.
 However, when we restrict this comparison to groups in which a female actor
 in the video provides information (whether alone or with a male co-actor)
 to female co-heads against groups in which a male actor provides information
 to female co-heads (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

, Model 2A), we do observe positive and statistically significant effects
 (top panel of Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:decide_women_model2AB"

\end_inset

).
 Specifically, we observe an increase of 0.16 in the women’s decision-making
 index and an increase in women’s decision-making about the timing for planting
 maize, about spacing, about striga control measures, and the timing of
 weeding that amount to 7, 9 and 7 pp respectively, which translates into
 increases of 26, 34 and 39 percent, respectively, over the mean of the
 control group.
 Challenging role incongruity among male co-heads by showing them the video
 that involves a female actor (whether alone or with a male co-actor) instead
 of a male actor (as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

, Model 2B) does not make a difference for women’s decision-making (bottom
 panel of Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:decide_women_model2AB"

\end_inset

).

 But, when the treatment group is restricted to the group in which female

We do find significant negative effects of involving women in receiving

 These negative effects on men’s individual decision-making do not only
 follow from giving the female co-head the information alone (in which case

While joint decision-making does not change as a result of variations in
 the information provider (bottom panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:decision_joint_main"

\end_inset

), men’s decision-making does.
 Men’s unilateral decision-making about whether to plant maize on the plot
 is reduced by 4 pp (an 11 percent reduction over the mean of the control)
 when a female actor is involved in providing the information (alone or
 together with a male actor) as compared to only a male actor, regardless
 of whom the video was shown to (Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowlege_main_men-1"

\end_inset

, Model 2).
 The fact that this reduction in men’s decision-making about whether to
 plant maize is mirrored when male co-heads viewed the video that involved
 a female actor instead of the video with only a male actor (Model 2B) may
 mean that role incongruity challenges may be at work among male co-heads
 or that men are susceptible to gender homophily effects (bottom panel in
 Appendix Table

\begin_layout Subsection
Adoption of Recommended Practices 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We apply the same approach to our presentation of changes in the likelihood
 that spouses both decide on a particular practice and subsequently adopt
 the practice that was recommended in the video.
 We start by making the comparison illustrated in Model 1 of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

.
 Results (top panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adoption_main"

\end_inset

) show a positive and statistically significant treatment effect of involving
 women in receiving information, denoted by an increase of 0.12 in the women’s
 adoption index.
 The likelihood of a woman both deciding and adopting a particular recommended
 practice increases by between 1 and 5 pp.
 Given that women alone both decided and adopt a particular practice is
 generally low in the control group, these changes translate into sizable
 percent increases.
 Effects remain generally consistent when the treatment group is restricted
 to the group in which the female co-head received the information alone
 (Model 1A in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

), in which case the women’s adoption index increases by 0.15 (top panel
 in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adoption_women_model1AB"

\end_inset

).
 When the treatment group is restricted to the group in which the female
 co-head receives the information together with her male spouse (Model 1B
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

), the women’s adoption index increases by 0.09 and only the likelihood of
 the female co-head unilateral deciding about striga control and adoption
 the recommended striga control strategy is positively affected (bottom
 panel in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adoption_women_model1AB"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We proceed by assessing the effects of variation in the information provider
 in the same manner as before (Model 2 of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

).
 Results (bottom panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adoption_main"

\end_inset

) do not indicate any difference in women’s adoption outcomes as a result
 of involving women in conveying information.
 But when we compare groups in which the female co-heads were shown the
 video with a female actor (alone or with a male co-actor) instead of the
 video with only a male actor (Model 2A of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

), there are indications of positive role-model effects on the likelihood
 that female co-heads both decide about when to plant and adopt the recommended
 timing of planting maize (top panel in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adoption_women_model2AB"

\end_inset

): an increase of 2.6 pp, which translates into a 62 percent increase over
 the mean of the control.

\end_inset

 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 Involving women in receiving information has a positive and significant
 effect of 1.5 pp on the likelihood of jointly deciding upon spacing and
 subsequent adoption of the recommended practice of spacing and number of
 seeds per hill (top panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adoption_joint"

\end_inset

).
 Joint adoption outcomes follow from providing the information to the female
 and male co-head together in contrast to only providing the male co-head
 with information (Model 1B of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

): Results (bottom panel in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adopt_joint_model1AB"

\end_inset

) show an increase in the joint adoption index of 0.08, a 2 pp increase in
 the jointly decided-upon adoption of proper spacing, and a 5 pp increase
 in the jointly decided-upon adoption of striga control measures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the appendix, we examine the effect of involving women as recipients
 and messengers on men’s adoption as well.
 Involving women in receiving information, alone or as part of the couple,
 as compared to giving the information only to the male co-head (Model 1
 of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

), reduces the likelihood that men unilaterally decide on and subsequently
 adopt striga control measures by 3 pp (top panel in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adoption_main_men"

\end_inset

).
 Providing only the female co-head with information as compared to only
 the male co-head (Model 1A of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

) reduces this likelihood by 4 pp.
 We further find that it also reduces the likelihood that men alone decide
 about when to weed and also follow recommendations by 6 pp, which is equivalent
 to a 30 percent reduction (top panel in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:adopt_men_model1AB"

The Use of Fertilizer and Improved Seeds 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we explore the impact of the different treatments on the
 use of specific types of fertilizer (DAP, urea, and organic fertilizer)
 and improved seeds (hybrids or OPVs) by women who decided individually
 upon using the specified inputs, by female and male co-heads who jointly
 decided upon using those inputs, and by men who individually decided upon
 using those inputs.
 
\end_layout

First, we examine the effect of involving women in receiving information,
 alone or as part of the couple (Model 1 of Figure

 Results (top panel Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:inputs_main"

\end_inset

) show a positive and significant increase of women’s input use index by
 0.08.
 The effect of providing only female co-heads with information as opposed
 to only male co-heads (as in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

, Model 1A) is an increase of the women’s input use index by 0.13.
 We register an increase of the use of all inputs (top panel of Appendix
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:input_women_model1AB"

\end_inset

 Providing the female co-heads together with their male co-heads with informatio
n as opposed to only the male co-heads (as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

, Model 1B) has only a weak effect on women’s input use index (bottom panel
 of Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:input_women_model1AB"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We continue by examining role-model effects with the comparison illustrated
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

, Model 2.
 Involving women in conveying extension information has a positive and significa
nt effect of 2 pp on the use of organic fertilizer by women who individually
 made the decision about its use (bottom panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:inputs_main"

\end_inset

).
 There are also indications of positive effects on women’s decided-upon
 use of OPVs and the women’s input use index.
 The estimated effects have p-values lower than 0.10 but are not significant
 according to FWER consistent significance thresholds.

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of involving women in receiving information, alone or as part
 of the couple, on input use decided upon by men is mixed: it is negative
 for the use of the fertilizer DAP and positive for organic fertilizer (Model
 1 of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

; top panel Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:input_main_men"

\end_inset

).
 The negative effect on men’s decided-upon use of DAP is driven by the female
 co-heads receiving the information alone (Model 1A of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

; top panel Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adopt_men_model1AB-1"

\end_inset

), which may be linked to men lacking information about the use of DAP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Involving women in conveying the information has no significant effects
 on joint input use (bottom panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:input_joint"

\end_inset

).
 Yet there are indications that jointly decided-upon use of urea increased
 by 2 pp as a result of female co-heads having seen the video with a female
 actor (alone or with a male co-actor) instead of the video with only a
 male actor (Model 2A of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

; top panel Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:input_joint_model2AB"

\end_inset

).
 The use of DAP individually decided upon by men, however, seems negatively
 affected by that treatment (bottom panel of Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:input_main_men"

\end_inset

).
 There are indications that the use of both urea and hybrid seed individually
 decided upon by men are positively affected as a result of showing male
 co-heads the video with a female actor (alone or with a male co-actor)
 instead of the video with only a male actor (bottom panel of Appendix Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adopt_men_model2AB-1"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Production and Productivity 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we assess effects on production and productivity of female-managed
 maize plots as a result of involving women in receiving information versus
 only targeting the man (as illustrated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

, Model 1).
 The results (top panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:prod_main"

\end_inset

) show a significant and positive increase of the total area of female-managed
 maize plots in the household, an increase of the total amount of household
 maize produced on female-managed plots, and an increase of the yield on
 female-managed maize plots.
 There is also a 2 pp increase in the likelihood of reporting better-than-normal
 yield.
 Both the share of household maize production and maize area under female
 management increased by 6 pp.
 The positive effects on production and productivity outcomes on female-managed
 plots that result from providing only the female co-head with information
 instead of the male co-head (Model 1A of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

) are even larger in magnitude (top panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:prod_women_model1AB"

\end_inset

).
 In contrast, involving the female co-head as part of a couple receiving
 the information instead of only the male co-head (Model 1B of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

) shows no effect on production and productivity outcomes on female-managed
 plots (bottom panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:prod_women_model1AB"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also again examine the effect of involving women in conveying the information
 rather than only a man (Model 2 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

) on production and productivity outcomes of female-managed plots.
 Results (bottom panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:prod_main"

\end_inset

) point to a significant and negative effect on the yield on female-managed
 plots.
 Suggestive indications of the negative effects on yield on female-managed
 plots emerge both when female co-heads and when male co-heads have seen
 the video featuring a female actor (alone or with a male co-actor) instead
 of the video featuring only a male actor (respectively Model 2A and Model
 2B in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

).
 In the latter case, there are also indications of a negative effect on
 production on female-managed plots (Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:prod_women_model2AB"

\end_inset

).

There is no evidence that production and productivity outcomes of jointly
 managed plots changed as a result of involving women in conveying the informati
on (alone or with a male co-actor) rather than only a man (bottom part of

 However, both as a result of showing female co-heads and as result of showing
 male co-heads the video featuring a female actor (alone or with a male
 co-actor) instead of the video with only a male actor (Model 2A and Model
 2B of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

), the likelihood that the yield on jointly managed plots is better than
 normal increased by about 4 pp.
 This translates into about a 40 percent increase over the mean of the control

Maize produced in the household independently sold by the female co-head
 is not affected by involving women in receiving information, alone or as
 part of the couple (top panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Yet providing the information to only the female co-head as opposed to
 providing it to only the male co-head (Model 1A of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Hypotheses-tests"

\end_inset

) increases the likelihood that she independently sells maize by 4 pp (top
 panel in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:sales_women_model1AB"

\end_inset

).
 As few women in the control group actually sell maize independently, this
 translates into a substantial percentage increase of 46 percent over the
 mean of the control.
 There are indications of a positive effect on the amount of maize sold
 independently by women as well.
 Sales of maize by the female and male co-head jointly does not change by
 involving women in receiving information, alone or as part of the couple
 (top panel in Table

Involving women in conveying information has a positive effect of 4 pp (though
 just under the FWER-consistent significance threshold) on the likelihood
 that maize produced in the household is jointly sold.
 This translates into a 12 percent increase over the mean of the control
 (bottom panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:sales_joint"

\end_inset

).
 An indication of a similar positive role model effect on joint sales emerges
 when women are involved in conveying information given to the female co-heads
 alone (top panel in Appendix Table

LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:sales_joint_model2AB"

 and negatively affected by involving women in conveying information (bottom

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we interpret the results provided in the previous section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Women’s Access to Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results suggest that, to some extent, spouses monopolize agricultural extension
 information.
 Involving women in receiving extension information (as opposed to exclusively
 targeting the male co-head) has positive effects on women’s individual
 knowledge.
 This finding suggests that male co-heads do not necessarily pass the informatio
n to their spouse.
 The fact that men’s knowledge, particularly knowledge about new information,
 is reduced when the information if targeted exclusively to the female co-head
 (as opposed to exclusively to the male co-head), suggests that female co-heads
 also do not necessarily share information with their spouse.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results further show that women’s knowledge gains are similar regardless
 of whether a woman saw the extension video alone or together with her male
 co-head; the presence of the male spouse in the exposure process does not
 influence her knowledge
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Interestingly, unlike for the female co-head, the presence of the female
 spouse in the exposure process does influence the knowledge of the male
 co-head, who appears to learn less when information is provided to the
 couple than when this information is targeted to him alone.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This suggest limited discussion of the content of the video between spouses
 even when the video was shown to both of them as a couple.
 Hence, from a knowledge transfer point of view, if the aim is to increase
 women knowledge, it seems most effective to exclusively target the female
 co-head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Women gain individual agricultural decision-making power when they are involved
 in receiving extension information, particularly if this information is
 exclusively provided to them.
 Joint decision-making remains unchanged.
 While reducing information asymmetries by targeting couples increases empowerme
nt, most gains are made by providing women with an informational advantage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Men’s unilateral decision-making is reduced as a result of involving women
 in receiving information, no matter if this happens by targeting the female
 co-head alone or together with the male co-head.
 If this reduction only occurred in the former case, men’s reduced decision-maki
ng could have been related to a lack of information.
 The fact that the reduction occurs in both cases suggests that men’s individual
 decision-making does not only decrease due to a lack of direct access to
 information.
 Apparently, the fact that women can also access information leads them
 to refrain from unilateral decision making
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At the same time, it should be noted that men also seem to learn less in
 the presence of women.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going beyond women’s decision-making, the adoption of recommended practices
 and use of inputs individually decided upon by women is also positively
 affected by providing women with information.
 Hence, women seem to use their increased agency as a result of increased
 information access to become more involved in farm-related activities.
 Additionally, the adoption of recommended practices and use of inputs jointly
 decided upon by the female and male co-head also increases as a result
 of involving women in receiving information: Informed women can also participat
e more in joint action.
 The positive effect on jointly decided adoption of recommended practices
 and inputs when the female and male co-heads receive the information together
 is consistent with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.1093/erae/jbv039"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who found a positive impact of joint participation in an extension program
 on fertilizer adoption on jointly (and male-) managed plots.
 The adoption of recommended practices and use of inputs individually decided
 upon by men is negatively affected by involving women as recipients of
 information, but the effect is less convincing than for male unilateral
 decision-making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result of providing only women with information, the total area of
 maize plots in the household managed by women increases and maize production
 on female-managed plots more than doubles.
 Apparently, the increase in decision making and adoption of recommended
 practices and inputs by women as a result of solely involving women as
 information recipients paid off in higher production, increased area, and
 higher productivity on female-managed maize plots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, providing the information to the female and male co-head together
 did not make a change for area, production and productivity of female-managed
 maize plots.
 This is probably due to the fact that providing the information to the
 female and male co-head together does not have the same strong positive
 effects on women’s individual agency as providing the information to only
 the woman.
 Her lack of an exclusive informational asset seems to be in the way of
 capitalizing on her gain of information.
 There is no evidence of an increase of maize production, productivity,
 nor area under cultivation under joint management as result of involving
 women in receiving information either.
 In sum, increased joint decision-making and adoption as a result of the
 female and male co-head receiving the information together did not pay
 off in higher production and productivity on jointly managed maize plots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Women are also more likely to sell (more) maize independently if they alone
 received the extension information instead of the male co-head.
 At the same time, sales of maize individually by men is less likely, which
 indicates that women’s increased agency as a result of unique access to
 information reduces men’s dominance over maize sales.
 Giving the information to the female and male co-head together does not
 affect women’s (nor men’s) individual sales of maize.
 Joint sales of maize remains unaffected by involving women in receiving
 information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Women seem to gain in production and sales if they receive agricultural
 extension information alone.
 However, these effects are not there if the information is given to the
 couple.
 This suggests that a woman’s monopoly over information is essential for
 her individual achievements.
 The fact that giving the information to the couple instead of only the
 male co-head increased women’s agency in terms of joint decision-making
 and adoption but not joint achievement implies that, despite women’s greater
 (joint) agency, these joint achievement are not different from what men
 individually achieve.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A question that remains is the extent to which the increased efforts by
 women that result from exclusively giving them extension information, in
 terms of applying the recommended practices and inputs and larger areas
 of maize cultivation under their management, augment their work burden.
 Indeed, we observe that the time women spent on preparing fields and weeding
 went up by 1.4 and 3.3 person-days/maize season, respectively, as a result
 of providing only the female co-head, instead of only the male co-head,
 with information.
 Women generally apply labor-based intensification practices, which are
 likely more accessible to women than capital intensive practices such as
 the use of improved seeds or fertilizer.
 This suggests the need for further research on the labor and drudgery implicati
ons of these outcomes and the need to reflect upon making less labor-intensive
 intensification practices accessible to women.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Role Model Effects 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We expected that including women in the extension information videos portrayed
 as farmers, whom viewers can relate to and who become successful by applying
 the practices shown in the video, would have had role model effects and
 improve women’s outcomes.
 The evidence, however, is mixed.
 There is no impact on women’s knowledge of agronomic practices, nor on
 women’s individual decision-making and adoption of recommended practices,
 and indications of a negative effect on the yield on female-managed plots
 and sales of maize by women.
 There is some indication of a positive role model effect on the use of
 organic fertilizer decided upon by women, a productivity-enhancing input
 that may be directly available to a woman without a need for bargaining.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are no effects of involving women in conveying information on joint
 outcomes either, except for an indication that jointly selling maize has
 become more likely.
 The lack of effects on joint decision-making and adoption means that couples
 nor men were inspired to accept a greater participation of women in those
 decisions.
 There are, however, negative effects on men’s unilateral decision-making,
 as well as on the amount of maize independently sold by men, which may
 make way for more involvement of women in decision-making and action.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zooming in on role model effects among female co-heads who viewed the extension
 information videos with women involved as messengers alone paints a slightly
 different picture.
 In this sub-sample, women’s individual decision-making increased as well
 as women’s individually decided-upon adoption of the appropriate timing
 for planting maize and use of organic fertilizer—again practices that are
 available to a woman at limited cost.
 Yet, the indication of a negative effect on yield on female-managed plots
 emerges in this case as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some indications of positive effects on joint outcomes as well,
 such as use of fertilizer, improved yields on jointly managed plots and
 a higher likelihood of jointly selling maize.
 The amount of maize sold independently by men seems to decrease as a result.
 The effects on joint and men’s outcomes of including women in the extension
 information videos shown to female co-heads alone seems to suggest that
 women who are inspired by the female role models not only gained individual
 agency but managed to make some changes at the couple level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effects of involving women in conveying information in the extension
 videos shown to male co-heads alone seem to have reduced men’s individual
 decision-making, particularly about whether to plant maize on a plot, men’s
 individually decided-upon adoption, and improve yield of jointly managed
 plots.
 These results may indicate that role model effects and particularly challenging
 role incongruity among male co-heads may have encouraged them to dominate
 agricultural decision-making less.
 At the same, to some extent, these results may be due to gender homophily
 effects on the part of the husband, as half of the treatment group were
 exposed to a video featuring only a woman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In sum, we find only weak evidence that role models work, both directly
 by increasing aspirations of women and indirectly by challenging role incongrui
ty of men.
 The fact that effects we find are less convincing than what other studies
 such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "RePEc:csa:wpaper:2017-13"

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.1162/qjec.2009.124.4.1497"

\end_inset

 find may be due to the fact that our intervention was relatively light.
 A 10 minute video, even though screened twice, is still quite different
 from a two hour feel good movie or first hand experience with women leaders
 over the course of multiple years of quota policy.
 Norms defining women's and men's role in agriculture may also be harder
 to change than in other contexts 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While evidence of effects of role models on success is scarce in the literature,
 we find indications of negative effects of female role models on yield
 and sales by women.
 One possible explanation may be that women opt to concentrate their efforts
 on other crops when men become less likely to decide on planting maize.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do not find that women move away from maize as a result of being exposed
 to role models.
 In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:prod_main"

\end_inset

, we do not find that area cultivated by maize is affected by women role
 models.
 The reduction in yields is entirely driven by a reduction in production
 on the same area planted.
 We do, however, find an, albeit weak, negative effect on time spent in
 agriculture, particular on preparing fields.
 Role model effects may this encourage women to spend more time on other
 crops (or activities), explaining the reduced productivity.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In smallholder agriculture, women perform a lot of the work, yet have little
 say in which crops to plant, what technologies and inputs to use, and how
 much of the crop to sell on the market.
 Targeting women with relevant information in formats that are appealing
 and accessible to them have been found to increase empowerment in a variety
 of settings, and so providing extension information tailored to women may
 be an effective way to increase their voice in agricultural production.
 However, public agricultural advisory services, the main source of agricultural
 information in many developing countries, remains severely male biased,
 with predominantly male experts targeting the main decision maker within
 the household, which is assumed to be the male co-head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we test how gender related attributes of digital agricultural
 extension information campaigns affect women’s access to informational
 resources, their agency, and their achievements in farming may increase,
 all of which directly relate to women’s empowerment in agriculture.
 We do this through a field experiment in the form of a factorial design
 that was run in eastern Uganda.
 Working with monogamous maize farming households, in one treatment arm,
 we assess the importance of the gender of the person within the household
 who is targeted with information for women's, joint and men's knowledge,
 decision making, adoption of recommended agronomic practices and technology,
 and outcomes.
 In a cross treatment, we test if the gender of the person who provides
 this information makes a difference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information intervention is implemented using short videos shown twice
 to farmers.
 In these videos, farmer-actors explain and demonstrate various strategies
 and practices to intensify the production of maize.
 Three versions were randomized across farming households: one version portrays
 a male farmer, another a female farmer, the third a couple formed by male
 and female farmers.
 Three constellations of recipients of information in the household were
 randomized as well: the male co-head alone, the female co-head alone, the
 male and female co-heads together as a couple.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results of this study clearly show that significant advances in women’s
 empowerment in agriculture are made by giving women direct and exclusive
 access to extension information.
 Furthermore, while the evidence is somewhat mixed, the results of this
 study suggest that women as role models, through peer effects, gender homophily
 effects, and/or through challenging role incongruity, influence women and
 men in different ways.
 In particular, women are inspired to aspire when they receive information
 delivered by women but cannot turn that into individual success, in terms
 of yield and maize sales.
 Men’s individual decision-making and agency, however, seems to reduce when
 men receive information delivered by women, which may create space for
 women’s participation in decision-making and action.
