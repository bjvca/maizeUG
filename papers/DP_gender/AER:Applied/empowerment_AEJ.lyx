\begin_layout Abstract
Agricultural extension services are generally biased towards men, with male
 extension agents targeting the man within the household.
 In a field experiment among maize-farming households in Uganda, we investigate
 the consequences of this by varying exposure to extension information by
 gender within the household, as well as by varying the gender of the person
 who provides this information.
 We find that targeting women increases their knowledge about improved maize
 management practices, their role in agricultural decision-making, their
 adoption of recommended practices and inputs, production-related outcomes,
 and quantity sold.
 The gender of the person providing information has mixed effects on empowerment.

Women provide a lot of work, yet men generally make the decisions.
 While women form a substantial part of the workforce these days, relatively
 few hold executive positions across a range of sectors and industries.
 One extreme example is that, according to Fortune 500's 2019 list, only
 6.6 percent of companies had a woman Chief Executive.
 And while there is an increase in the share of women in middle management
 globally, women are often promoted in positions that involve little strategic
 decisions making, such as human resource departments or communications.
 This problem is even more compelling when considering unpaid work such
 as household care and child care.
 For instance, while women bare the brunt of child care, their voice in
 deciding how many children to have is limited

 Economic dependency upon men in the context of strict gender norms means
 that the vast majority of women in developing countries lack the ability

One route towards increasing women empowerment may be targeting them with

Information campaigns have several features that determine effectiveness.
 In addition to who is targeted by the information, the source of the informatio

 Some studies show that information may be more credible if it comes from

 Homophily effects, where women learn more from other women, may be particularly
 important for women empowerment.
 More recently, the behavioral economics literature also started to point
 out the importance of role models, suggesting important non-cognitive impact
 pathways that can be exploited in information campaigns.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 show that successful role models can increase entry in traditionally male
 dominated sectors.
 Role models not only affect the behavior of those that identify with the
 model; they have also been found to influence the behavior of others in
 situations where women are constrained by relationships and social norms

 However, there are many well-established benefits to empowering women farmers
 in developing countries.
 A more prominent role for women in the farm household has been shown to
 result in more efficient allocations of scarce resources within the household,
 more equitable distributions of the returns to investments in household
 production, and general improvements in welfare and poverty

 conditions most comparable to themselves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of smallholder agriculture in developing countries, information
 related to productivity-enhancing technologies and practices is generally
 disseminated though public agricultural extension information systems.
 However, agricultural extension systems are generally biased toward men,
 with information targeted mainly to male members of a farming household
 and in formats that are rarely tailored to female members.
 A recent survey on public service delivery in Uganda found that only 16
 percent of extension agents are women.
 As such, extension information systems fail to recognize gendered power
 dynamics governing intra-household information exchanges and confirm a
 worldview in which women are largely absent from agricultural decision-making

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we examine ways in which extension services can be designed
 to effectively increase women’s access to informational resources, their
 agency, and their achievements in farming, all of which directly relate
 to women’s empowerment in agriculture.
 Specifically, we conduct a field experiment among 3,600 maize-farming household
s in eastern Uganda to test cognitive and behavioral channels through which
 extension information affects outcomes related to maize management and
 production.
 To test the cognitive channel, we compare outcomes of households where
 the female co-head was included in the target audience to outcomes of household
s where information was targeted to the male co-head alone.
 To test the behavioral channel, we compare outcomes of households where
 a women was included in the dissemination of the information to outcomes
 of households where the information is provided by only a man.
 Our experimental design also allows us to test for the existence of gender
 homophily effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information intervention is implemented as a short video that provides
 viewers with information and recommendations on appropriate input use,
 management practices, and investment strategies that can be followed to
 obtain higher maize yields.
 To test the impact of reducing information asymmetries between spouses,
 we randomly varied who was shown the video within the household.
 This could either be the male co-head alone, the women co-head alone, or
 both co-heads together (the couple).
 Furthermore, three versions of the video were created—one featuring a male
 actor, another featuring a female actor, and a third featuring both actors
 together—with no difference in the information contained in the video.
 Varying the exposure to the actors of different gender in this way allows
 us to test a second hypothesis related to the importance of role models
 to empower women.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that targeting women with extension videos has a positive effect
 on different domains of empowerment including their knowledge of agronomic
 practices; participation in agricultural decision-making especially on
 the adoption of recommended practices and inputs; increased maize yields,
 quantities and sales by women.
 However, portraying women as successful farmers and role models in the
 screening produces mixed results in these domains.
 Further, results suggest that role-model effects work differently for women
 and men.

\begin_layout Standard
This section offers a non-exhaustive review of the literature on gender

 Specific emphasis is placed on the gendered dimensions of intra-household
 asymmetries of information and role models, drawing on examples that highlight
 their influence on technology adoption and extension service provision.

Throughout the study, we define empowerment as a process where those (women)
 who were previously denied the ability to make and act upon important choices
 in their lives gain such ability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1111/1467-7660.00125"

\end_inset

.
 This ability to make choices is based on three main components: access
 to resources including material assets, informational resources, and social
 capital; agency, including a person’s ability to act on their decisions;
 and achievement, or social and economic outcomes such as income and well-being.
 Women’s empowerment can imply that women have greater ability to make and
 act upon choices both individually or jointly within the household

Intra-household Information Asymmetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Much of the literature on gender, agriculture, and technology adoption approache
s intra-household information asymmetries as an example of inefficient intra-hou
sehold resource allocation, where the key resource in question is information.
 Intra-household information asymmetries both affect and are affected by
 women’s status, role, and welfare relative to other household members 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "DOSS201869"

\end_inset

.
 In general, information asymmetries are the result of differential costs
 on the acquisition and use of information that results in a lack of awareness
 about available resources or how to allocate them more efficiently.
 This may result in forgone income-enhancing or asset-accumulation opportunities
 or acceptance of unnecessarily high risks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is ample evidence that women face information deficiencies and asymmetries
 relative to men in a range of circumstances, and thus may hold weaker bargainin
g positions.
 In agriculture, women farmers have been shown to be more deprived of informatio
n regarding good agronomic practices 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1111/j.1574-0862.2001.tb00233.x,DOSS20012075,10.1093/erae/jbv039"

 In certain situations, this may be directly linked to unequal access to
 agricultural extension and advisory services between men and women farmers
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "NDIRITU2014117"

\end_inset

.
 This unequal access may contribute to lower adoption rates of improved
 agricultural practices and technologies among women.
 For example, studies show that with equal access to extension services,
 land, and labor, men and women farmers in male-headed households in Ghana
 would be as likely to adopt modern agronomic practices 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1111/j.1574-0862.2001.tb00233.x"

s in banana cultivation as men in male-headed households if they were as
 knowledgeable about the technology

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Women’s access to information—specifically, to information provided by agricultu
ral extension services—may be subject to both extra-household and intra-househol
d constraints.
 The extra-household constraints can be infrastructural and logistic, for
 instance, women not being targeted for extension services, women lacking
 the money to travel to extension training locations, or women lacking the
 time to attend because of household management, domestic and reproductive
 responsibilities 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "wodon2006gender"

\end_inset

.
 Extra-household constraints may also exist in terms of information content
 or delivery: it may not be adapted to women’s interests or needs, or may
 not recognize women’s role as agricultural producers, and therefore may
 not appeal to women.
 Human capital constraints may also play a role given women’s generally
 lower levels of education in many rural contexts in developing countries.
 Norms limiting women’s mobility and women’s interaction with men may impose
 additional constraints 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "FLETSCHNER20111422"

\end_inset

.
 These extra-household constraints to women’s access to information mean
 that, in many situations, women may rely more on informal networks for
 gathering information.
 When these networks are gender-specific and gender-segregated, problems
 associated with asymmetric information persist

A (married) woman’s interaction with her husband may often be her (intra-househo

 This assumption is implicit in most extension strategies that target the
 male household head 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "FLETSCHNER20111422"

 Yet the assumption requires that the preferences of male and female co-heads
 within a household align; that household resources, including information,
 are shared; and that households cooperate to reach Pareto-optimal outcomes.
 This unitary theory of the household has been challenged in theoretical

The power of role models can also be linked to the fact that people’s tendency

 Role models thus have been found important in challenging role incongruity,
 which can be defined as prejudiced views and cognitive biases about the
 capabilities of specific social groups in specific social roles that arise
 from a combination of perceptions about the characteristics of members
 of that social group and perceptions about the capabilities and characteristics
 that specific social roles require

 Role models can affect women empowerment directly: as women start questioning
 cultural norms and gender stereotypes, their locus of control may shift,
 resulting in increased entry into traditionally male-dominated domains.
 Indirectly, role models can challenge beliefs and stereotypes about lesser
 abilities of another group held by the group whose abilities are not underestim
ated.
 For example,

Other mechanisms, including peer effects (which are linked to recognition
 and conformity) and gender homophily may also be at play in the case of

 Gender homophily is defined as the preference for interaction with individuals

We explore cognitive and socio-psychological dimensions of extension information
 campaigns on various dimensions of women’s empowerment.
 We consider women’s empowerment along the lines of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "JOHNSON2016295"

\end_inset

, where empowerment encompasses both an increase in women’s individual and
 joint decision-making within the household with respect to a set of key
 livelihood-related variables.
 We consider empowerment as a positive change both for a woman and for the
 female and male co-heads jointly in their knowledge about recommended agronomic
 practices and inputs, their participation in intra-household decision-making
 on farm production, the choices they make about the adoption of recommended
 practices and the use of inputs, the output and yield from plots under
 either women’s or joint management, and their participation in selling
 farm output.
 A reduction in male domination over these different dimensions is considered
 empowering as well.
 In the context of our study, these variables are specific to the types
 of smallholders defined by our population of interest (and described in
 detail below), but are likely to be generalizable to other smallholder
 agricultural contexts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a first hypothesis, we test the relative importance of the cognitive
 dimension.
 Involving women in receiving extension information may strengthen women’s
 knowledge about recommended practices and inputs, and possibly make common
 knowledge about other agronomic practices more salient.
 There are different ways in which (also) targeting women with information
 may lead to these outcomes.
 The first assumes that information that would otherwise be, to some extent,
 monopolized by the male co-head, now also reaches women.
 If the female co-head receives the information alone and does not monopolize
 that information or if both the female and male co-head of a household
 receive the information as a couple, we would expect an increase in both
 women’s individual knowledge and the couple’s overall (joint) knowledge
 where intra-household communication, consultation, and learning occur,
 which can lead to an increase in women’s individual and joint decision-making
 and outcomes.
 If the female co-head receives the information alone, she might also monopolize
 that information, in which case changes in women’s individual knowledge,
 decision-making and outcomes may be expected.
 The second channel is through a change in a woman’s bargaining position
 that results from possession of an informational asset, which may prevent
 a male co-head from advancing his preferences at the expense of hers.
 These channels may be constrained by a woman’s limited access to the markets—bo
th material and financial—and if the woman is a late adopter, which may
 limit the realization of benefits.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a second hypothesis, we test the relative importance of the behavioral
 pathway.
 Directly involving women in conveying information may also affect women’s
 empowerment.
 Giving women key roles in conveying information may affect recipients of
 the information via role-model effects.
 Role model effects work via learning externalities through peers and gender
 homophily effects.
 In addition, role models may also challenge role incongruity.
 Peer effects occur where information recipients can relate to the information
 messenger as a peer—as an individual with a similar identity or experience,
 or as an individual possessing credible knowledge and information.
 Gender homophily effects occur where these peer effects are specifically
 based on a match in the sex of the messenger and recipient.
 Role incongruity effects occur where women update their beliefs about roles
 and responsibilities in the household as a result of receiving information
 from a messenger that is somehow inconsistent with their beliefs.
 We expect such effects to increase women’s aspirations about their households
 and livelihoods, thereby causing them to make more ambitious choices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Role incongruity may also work indirectly.
 The involvement of women in conveying information may cause men to revise
 their beliefs about women’s agency and capacity to make sound investment
 decisions on the farm.
 As a result, men may leave more space for decision-making by their wife
 and relax any inhibition to their wife’s access to complementary inputs,
 their decision-making on the adoption of recommended practices, or the
 improvement of crop production.

To explore these effects, we conducted a field experiment in 2017 among
 smallholder maize-farming households in eastern Uganda.
 Participants in the field experiment were drawn from monogamous maize-cultivati
ng households residing in five districts where maize is particularly important,
 both as a staple and as a marketable crop.
 The experiment was conducted during the second maize-growing season which
 runs from approximately August to January of the following year, and is
 characterized by a shorter period of rainfall than the first maize-growing
 season.
 During this second season, the complete cycle from planting to harvest
 requires three to three and a half months, and farmers tend to cultivate
 early-maturing but lower yielding maize varieties.
 Fields are prepared in August, planted in September, and harvested from
 December onward.
 
\end_layout

Maize yields in the study area, and in Uganda more generally, are well below
 their potential.

 730 kg per acre and 1,820 kg per acre

 Yet, on-farm estimates are generally lower.

 and 995 kg per acre

 There is also evidence that maize plots under female management are less
 productive than maize plots under male management.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 observe that male-managed plots are on average 17.5 percent more productive
 than female-managed plots in Uganda.
 They link the productivity gap between male- and female-managed plots in
 Uganda (controlled for plot size but without distinguishing between type
 of crops) to an unequal distribution between men and women of responsibilities
 and resources, including modern inputs such as improved varieties, fertilizer,
 and agrochemicals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decision-making power over agricultural production is related to the actual
 or perceived ownership of the land.
 In Uganda, ownership of land for married women is constrained by patrilineal
 land inheritance customs and by customs and traditional rules prescribing
 that, through marriage, women gain access to land owned by their husband.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 show that in eastern Uganda, married women farmers are the primary owners
 of only 2.7 percent of all maize plots in the study’s sample, and are the
 main decision-maker for the choice of maize variety on only 15.4 percent
 of the plots.
 They did not find evidence that land quality (in terms of soil fertility
 and slope) or type of tenure differ between female- and male-managed maize
 plots.
 Decision-making power is also related to customary gender roles and responsibil
ities which, in turn, affect intra-household labor allocations.
 Based on data from the 2011/12 Uganda Living Standards Measurement Study
 (LSMS), 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "FISHER201582"

\end_inset

 further found that, in total, more household labor was used on male-managed
 maize plots than on female-managed maize plots in male-headed households.
 On those female-managed plots, more female and child labor (and less male
 labor) was allocated to maize cultivation.
 In Uganda, generally, men tend to concentrate on marketable crops that
 generate cash income, while women tend to focus on other food crops for
 household consumption.

 related to knowledge, intra-household decision-making, adoption of maize
 cultivation practices, maize outputs and yields, and maize marketing, both
 for women individually and jointly with their male co-heads of households.
 To do so, we developed a 3x3 factorial design, in which one factor corresponds
 to the gender of the person (or persons) who receives the information (hencefor

During implementation of the experiment, one of these three versions of

 the treatment arm that the household was randomly assigned to.
 The videos were shown on 10-inch Android tablet computers by trained field
 enumerators during a private meeting with the participant (or participants
 if the recipient was the couple).
 Information on the sampled households and their treatment assignment was
 pre-loaded onto the tablet computers, such that the correct video was automatic
ally queued and enumerators were only able to screen the appropriate version
 of the video.
 The video was shown twice to our study participants, once before the maize
 planting time (July 2017) and once around the actual time of planting time
 (August 2017).

The video itself consists of a 10-minute inspirational story in which a
 farmer (man, woman, or a couple) recounts how s/he used to struggle with
 low maize yields.
 The actor-farmer then shows what inputs s/he used and what recommended
 practices s/he followed to successfully increase his/her yields.
 The choice of what inputs and practices to promote in this video was based
 on key informant interviews conducted in May 2017 with agronomists, maize
 breeders, district agricultural officers and other government staff, extension
 workers, and maize farmers.
 The information provided in the video is also generally consistent with
 the package of recommendations promoted by the Ugandan Ministry of Agriculture,

 of fresh seed of improved maize varieties and hybrids; and crop management
 practices such as timely planting, optimal plant spacing, and timely weeding.
 The video also contained content on the costs and benefits of the different
 practices and inputs being promoted, and recommended that viewers take
 a long-term perspective on improving their maize cultivation by starting
 small and reinvesting profits on increasingly larger areas of land.

 or as part of a couple) to outcomes of the 1,139 households where only
 the male co-head watched the video (Model 1).
 There are likely to be different effects from showing the video to the
 female co-head alone as compared to showing it to the female co-head as
 part of the couple, for instance related to the possibility of monopolizing
 information or gaining bargaining power on the basis of uniquely held informati

Data were collected from households in five districts in eastern Uganda:
 Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo, and Namutumba.
 From among these districts, we first removed town councils and two sub-counties
 that consisted of islands in Lake Victoria.
 We then used a two-stage cluster sampling approach to obtain a representative
 sample of this population.
 Specifically, we first selected parishes randomly and in proportion to
 the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all households, from which we randomly
 selected households to be included in the study.
 Because we assume that outcomes within villages will be correlated (e.g.,
 due to local weather conditions, or development programs that are implemented
 in certain areas), we used the village as a blocking factor such that in
 each village, we ensured that all possible treatment combinations related
 to the two factors were administered.
 Because the experimental design described above lays out nine different
 treatment combinations, a maximum of nine different households were selected
 in each village.

The table also serves as a balance test for the different comparisons we

 We observe baseline imbalances in observable characteristics that are statistic

 and find that certain groups are significantly different in the characteristics
 we measured at baseline.
 We will control for baseline characteristics that show up as significant
 in the balance tables by estimating analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models

Since this study aims to estimate effects on women’s empowerment, we consider
 a woman as ‘empowered’ not only if she achieves things on her own, but
 also if she does so in partnership with the man co-head in the household.
 Thus, we examine effects on both women’s outcomes and outcomes that are
 shared (joint) between the female and male co-heads of household.
 Those outcomes are cast as increases in (a) the female co-head’s knowledge
 (individually and/or jointly with her male co-head) about the information
 promoted in the video; (b) the extent to which maize production decisions
 in the household are taken by the female co-head alone and/or jointly with
 her male co-head; (c) the adoption of the recommended practices and inputs
 decided upon by the female co-head individually and/or jointly with her
 male co-head; (d) output and yield on maize plots that were female-managed
 and/or jointly managed; and (e) maize sales decided upon by the female
 co-head individually or jointly with her male co-head.
 Additionally, we will examine effects on men’s outcomes assuming that a
 reduction of men’s individual decision-making and adoption can be empowering
 for women as well.

\begin_layout Standard
Knowledge about four different practices recommended in the video is measured
 by the extent to which respondents answered correctly to multiple choice
 questions about the practices.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
First, respondents are considered knowledgeable about plant spacing if they
 correctly answered that the best spacing is two and a half feet between
 rows and one foot between plants and one seed per hill.
 Second, respondents are considered knowledgeable about combining practices
 if they correctly answered they would allocate 40,000 Ugandan shillings
 to buy improved seed and fertilizer, as combining inputs is a better strategy
 than putting all the eggs in one basket.
 Third, respondents are considered knowledgeable about optimal weeding if
 they correctly answered weeding is most important during the first four
 weeks after planting.
 Fourth, respondents are considered knowledgeable about fall armyworm control
 if they correctly answered that spraying in the evening is most effective
 since fall armyworm eats during night.
 This information was not provided in the video but could be common knowledge
 made more salient by providing the other agronomic information.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 A woman’s (man’s) knowledge score is based on responses from the female
 (male) co-head; the joint knowledge score is based on responses from both
 the female and male co-heads, where it was considered a correct joint answer
 if both of them got the answer correct, otherwise, not.
 We combine the outcomes of the four knowledge questions into a Women’s
 Knowledge Index, a Joint Knowledge Index and a Men’s Knowledge Index, which
 are constructed as the weighted mean of the individual standardized outcomes,
 using as weights the inverse of the co-variance matrix of the transformed
 outcomes (Anderson 2008).
 This, in addition to adjustments to the significance levels to account
 for Family Wise Error Rates (FWER), guards against over-rejection of the
 null hypothesis due to multiple inference.
 We used re-randomization to construct the joint null distribution for the
 family of outcomes we are testing.
 From this family-wise sharp null, we obtained the corresponding FWER-consistent
 significance thresholds by determining which cutoffs yield 10 percent,
 five percent and one percent significant hypothesis tests across all tests
 and simulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agricultural decision-making is based on women’s answers about whether she
 made particular decisions related to household maize production individually
 or jointly with her spouse, or whether her husband made the decisions by
 himself.
 We look at the following decisions: whether to plant maize on a particular
 plot; the timing of maize planting (the number of days after the start
 of the rain) on a particular plot; the spacing of maize plants and the
 number of seeds to plant per hill; how to control striga on a particular
 plot; and the timing of the first weeding on a particular plot.
 Per household, we consider the proportion of maize plots within the household
 on which the female co-head reported to have made the decision alone (jointly,
 or her husband alone).
 Following a similar procedure as discussed above, we constructed a Women’s
 Decision-making Index, based on the proportion of the household’s maize
 plots for which the female co-head made the decisions described above alone,
 along with a corresponding Joint Decision-making Index and Men’s Decision-makin
g Index.
 We also calculated FWER-consistent significance thresholds for the family
 of decision-making outcomes in the same manner as discussed above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we consider actual adoption of the practices recommended in the video
 upon which, according to the female co-head respondent, she individually
 made decisions or jointly with her male co-head, or her husband did.
 We specifically consider the proportion of the household’s maize plots
 for which the female co-head decided about a particular practice alone
 and adopted the recommended practice by herself (respectively the proportion
 of the household’s maize plots for which the female and male co-head decided
 and adopted a particular practice jointly, and for which the male co-head
 decided and adopted the practice alone).

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is important to note that our intervention may change both the likelihood
 that a spouse makes a decision as well as the likelihood that the decision
 maker then adopts what was recommended in the video.
 In other words, we only observe the reduced form outcome of our intervention:
 P(Adoption by woman * Decision by woman) with P(Adoption by woman * Decision
 by woman) = P(Adoption by woman | Decision by woman) * P(Decision by woman).
 P(Adoption by woman * Decision by woman) is what estimated in Table 6 and
 P(Decision by woman) is estimated in Table 5.
 For reference purposes, women’s likelihood of adoption on condition of
 making the decision by herself = P(Adoption by woman | Decision by woman)
 = P(Adoption by woman * Decision by woman) / P(Decision by woman).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We measure adoption of the following practices: planting within one day
 after the start of the rain, using the correct spacing and number of seeds
 per hill, removing striga before it flowers, and doing the first weeding
 in the third week after planting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We measure use of inputs such as DAP (
\emph on
Diammonium phosphate
\emph default
), urea, organic fertilizer, maize hybrids, and open pollinated varieties
 (OPVs).
 We specifically consider the proportion of the household’s maize plots
 for which a particular input was used and this was decided individually
 by the female co-head (jointly/individually by the male co-head) (based
 on the female co-head’s answers).
\begin_inset Foot

 As before, we used the same method to construct a Women’s Adoption Index,
 a Joint Adoption Index, a Men’s Adoption index, a Women’s Input Use Index,
 a Joint Input Use Index, and a Men’s Input Use Index and defined FWER-consisten
t significance thresholds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we measured outcomes related to production, area of production, and
 productivity on maize plots under female and joint management.
 Female (jointly) managed plots are defined as plots on which, according
 to female co-head respondents, female co-heads alone (jointly) took at
 least three out of five decisions about planting maize on the plot, the
 timing of planting, spacing and seed rate, striga control, and the timing
 of the first weeding.
 We use the total amount of maize produced on female-managed maize plots
 within the household as our measure of production.
 The area of production is the total area (in acres) of female-managed maize
 plots in the household.
 Yield (in kg per acre) is the total amount of maize produced on female-managed
 plots divided by the total area of the female-managed maize plots in the
 household.
 A secondary, more subjective indicator for yield takes the value of one
 if the female co-head respondent believes the yield on at least one of
 her maize plots was greater than in a normal year.
 To capture the change in women’s control over total household production,
 we measure both the share of household maize production that was produced
 on female-managed maize plots and the share of household acreage under
 maize cultivation that is on female-managed maize plots.
 We also defined indicators for jointly managed plots, and calculated FWER-consi
stent significance thresholds.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we looked at maize sales as an outcome.
 A first indicator takes the value of one if any amount of the maize produced
 in the household was reported by the female co-head respondent to have
 been sold independently by the female co-head (respectively, jointly and
 independently by the male co-head).
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Selling independently by the female (male) co-head means all decisions regarding
 quantity, price and to whom the maize was sold were taken by the female
 (male) co-head according to the female co-head respondent.
 Jointly means all those decisions were taken together by the female and
 male co-head together.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 A second indicator is the amount of maize (in bags of about 100 kg) that
 the woman respondent reported to have sold independently (jointly/independently
 by the male co-head).
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that for the first indicator of the likelihood of selling independently
 we assumed women did not sell any maize independently if they did not know
 the amount sold independently.
 For the second indicator (amount of maize sold independently), we only
 considered positive amounts of maize sold independently.

\begin_layout Subsection
Knowledge of recommended practices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin our discussion of results by initially examining women’s and joint
 (couple’s) knowledge outcomes, focusing on the knowledge index described
 earlier as well as the individual recommended practices that respondents
 answered questions about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we examine whether involving women as recipients of information leads
 to an increase in their knowledge.
 We do this by comparing: (a) groups in which female co-heads received the
 information, either alone or with their male spouse, against (b) groups
 in which only the male co-head received the information (, Model 1).
 Results (Table 4,Error: Reference source not found Model 1, Panel a) show
 a positive and statistically significant treatment effect on the women’s
 knowledge index of 0.11.
 We further observe positive and significant treatment effects of involving
 women as recipients of information on women’s knowledge about adequate
 spacing and the number of maize seeds per hill of 7 percentage points (pp).
 This translates into a 52 percent increase over the mean of the control
 group.
 We observe a similar 5 pp increase in women’s knowledge about combining
 practices and starting small.
 These results remain consistent when the treatment group is restricted
 to: (a) the group in which the female co-head received the information
 alone (, Model 1A; Table 4, Model 1A, Panel a), and (b) the group in which
 she receives the information together with her male spouse (, Model 1B;
 Appendix Table 4A, Model 1B, Panel a).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, we examine joint knowledge outcomes, and present results in terms
 of a comparison between the same sets of groups ( Model 1).
 Results (Table 4, Model 1, Panel b) show no significant effects of the
 treatment on joint knowledge outcomes.
 There is an indication that new information (about spacing) received by
 female co-heads alone is somewhat less likely to be passed on to their
 spouses than when male co-heads received the information, which is evident
 from the negative treatment effect of –3 pp on joint knowledge (significant
 at 11 percent) (Table 4, Model 1A, Panel b).
 Men’s knowledge index, and particularly his knowledge of new information
 (about spacing and starting small with a combination of practices), is
 negatively affected by involving women in receiving information (Appendix
 Table 4B, Model 1).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, we examine the knowledge outcomes that result from variation in the
 provider of information.
 We examine results for role-model effects by examining women’s knowledge
 outcomes in terms of a comparison between: (a) groups in which a female
 actor in the video provides information (whether alone or with a male co-actor)
 against (b) groups in which only a male actor provides information (, Model
 2).
 Results (Table 4, Model 2, Panel a) show no evidence of a generalized role-mode
l effect: we observe no change in women’s knowledge outcomes as a result
 of female actors providing information.
 Fourth, joint knowledge outcomes seem unaffected by involving women in
 conveying the information as well (Table 4, Model 2, Panel b).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Decision-making about maize production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we explore the effect of the treatments on decision-making in the
 household.
 We do this by first examining whether involving women as information recipients
 (alone or as part of a couple) results in their participation in decisions
 about maize production on an average plot managed by the household.
 We do this by again making the comparison as described in the previous
 section and illustrated in , Model 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results (Table 5, Model 1, Panel a) shows a positive and statistically significa
nt treatment effect of 0.13 on the women’s decision-making index.
 The results are also evident across all of the decisions, where low mean
 values in the control group suggest high percent increases in women’s decision-
making.
 A restriction of the comparison to the treatment group in which the female
 co-head received the information alone versus the male co-head alone (as
 in , Model 1A) shows a larger positive effect on the women’s decision-making
 index of 0.22 (Table 5, Model 1A, Panel a).
 No such increase is found when the treatment group is restricted to the
 group in which female co-heads received the information together with their
 male spouse (, Model 1B; Appendix Error: Reference source not found, Model
 1B, Panel a).
 This implies that the gains in women’s individual decision-making are largely
 driven by providing only the female co-heads with information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find no change in joint decision-making outcomes as a result of involving
 women as information recipients (alone or as part of a couple) based on
 a comparison between the same groups (, Model 1; Table 5, Model 1, Panel
 b).
 But, when the treatment group is restricted to the group in which female
 co-heads received the information together with their male spouse (as in
 , Model 1B), there is a significant and positive effect on joint decision-makin
g about the novel way of spacing and number of seeds (Appendix Error: Reference
 source not found, Model 1B, Panel b).
 We do find significant negative effects of involving women in receiving
 information on men’s individual decision-making.
 The men’s decision-making index decreases by 0.18 and men are less likely
 to make each of the decisions alone (Appendix Table 5B, Model 1).
 These negative effects on men’s individual decision-making do not only
 follow from giving the female co-head the information alone (in which case
 the female co-head can monopolize the information) (, Model 1A; Appendix
 Table 5B, Model 1A), but also from giving the female and male co-head the
 information together (, Model 1B; Appendix Table 5B, Model 1B).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we explore decision-making outcomes that result from variations in
 the information provider by making the same comparison as described in
 the previous section and illustrated in , Model 2.
 Results (Table 5, Model 2, Panel a) show no evidence of a generalized role-mode
l effect on women’s decision-making.
 However, when we restrict this comparison to groups in which a female actor
 in the video provides information (whether alone or with a male co-actor)
 to female co-heads against groups in which a male actor provides information
 to female co-heads (, Model 2A), we do observe positive and statistically
 significant effects associated with role-model effects (Appendix Table
 5A, Model 2A, Panel a).
 Specifically, we observe an increase of 0.16 in the women’s decision-making
 index and increases in women’s decision-making about the timing for planting
 maize, about spacing, about striga control measures, and the timing of
 weeding that amount to 7, 9 and 7 pp respectively, which translates into
 increases of 26, 34 and 39 percent, respectively, over the mean of the
 control group.
 Challenging role incongruity among male co-heads by showing them the video
 that involves a female actor (whether alone or with a male co-actor) instead
 of a male actor (as in , Model 2B) does not make a difference for women’s
 decision-making (Appendix Table 5B, Model 2A, Panel a).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While joint decision-making does not change as a result of variations in
 the information provider (Table 5, Model 2, Panel b), men’s decision-making
 does.
 Men’s unilateral decision-making about whether to plant maize on the plot
 is reduced by 4 pp (an 11 percent reduction over the mean of the control)
 when a female actor is involved in providing the information (alone or
 together with a male actor) as compared to only a male actor, regardless
 of whom the video was shown to (Appendix Table 5B, Model 2).
 The fact that this reduction in men’s decision-making about whether to
 plant maize is mirrored when male co-heads viewed the video that involved
 a female actor instead of the video with only a male actor (, Model 2B)
 demonstrates that role incongruity challenges may be at work among male
 co-heads (Appendix Table 5B, Model 2B).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adoption of recommended practices 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We apply the same approach to our presentation of adoption outcomes, tested
 by making the comparison illustrated in , Model 1.
 Results (Table 6, Model 1, Panel a) shows a positive and statistically
 significant treatment effect of involving women in receiving information,
 denoted by an increase of 0.12 in the women’s adoption index.
 The likelihood of adoption of each of the practices individually decided
 upon by the female co-head increases between 1 and 5 pp.
 Given that adoption individually decided upon by the female co-head is
 generally low in the control group, these changes translate into sizable
 percent increases in women’s decided-upon adoption.
 Effects remain generally consistent when the treatment group is restricted
 to the group in which the female co-head received the information alone
 (as in , Model 1A), in which case the women’s adoption index increases
 by 0.15 (Table 6, Model 1A, Panel a).
 When the treatment group is restricted to the group in which the female
 co-head receives the information together with her male spouse (as in ,
 Model 1B), the women’s adoption index increases by 0.09 and only the adoption
 of striga control measures decided upon by the female co-head is positively
 affected (Appendix Table 6A, Model 1B, Panel a).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, we examine joint adoption outcomes, and present results in terms
 of a comparison between the same sets of groups as in Model 1.
 Involving women in receiving information has a positive significant effect
 of 2 pp on the adoption of the novel practice of spacing and number of
 seeds per hill jointly decided upon by the female and male co-head (Table
 6, Model 1, Panel b).
 Joint adoption outcomes follow from providing the information to the female
 and male co-head together in contrast to only providing the male co-head
 with information, as illustrated in , Model 1B.
 Results (Appendix Table 6A, Model 1B, Panel b) show an increase in the
 joint adoption index of 0.08, a 2 pp increase in the jointly decided-upon
 adoption of proper spacing, and a 5 pp increase in the jointly decided-upon
 adoption of striga control measures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we examine the effect on men’s adoption outcomes by the making the
 same comparisons between groups.
 Involving women in receiving information, alone or as part of the couple,
 as compared to giving the information only to the male co-head (as in ,
 Model 1), reduces men’s individually decided-upon adoption of striga control
 measures by 3 pp (Appendix Table 6B, Model 1).
 Providing only the female co-head with information as compared to only
 the male co-head (as in , Model 1A) reduces men’s individually decided-upon
 adoption of striga control measures by 4 pp and timely weeding practices
 by 6 pp, which come down to about a 30 percent reduction (Appendix Table
 6B, Model 1A).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We proceed by assessing the effects of variation in the information provider
 in the same manner as before (as in , Model 2).
 Results (Table 6, Model 2, Panel a) do not indicate any difference in women’s
 adoption outcomes as a result of involving women in conveying information.
 But when we make the comparison between the groups in which the female
 co-heads were shown the video with a female actor (alone or with a male
 co-actor) instead of the video with only a male actor (as in , Model 2A),
 there are indications of positive role-model effects on women’s individually
 decided-upon adoption of the appropriate timing of planting maize (Appendix
 Table 6A Model 2A Panel a): an increase of 3 pp, which translates into
 a 62 percent increase over the mean of the control.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Involving women in conveying information does not make any difference in
 joint adoption outcomes (Table 6, Model 2, Panel b).
 There are indications, however, that men’s adoption outcomes are negatively
 affected by showing male co-heads the video with a female actor (whether
 alone or with a male co-actor) rather than with only a male actor (as illustrat
ed in , Model 2B).
 Results (Appendix Table 6B, Model 2B) show a decrease of 3 pp (a 38 percent
 decrease relative to the mean of the control) in men’s individually decided-upo
n adoption of the appropriate timing for planting maize.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The use of fertilizer and improved seeds 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we explore the impact of the different treatments on the
 use of specific types of fertilizer (DAP, urea, and organic fertilizer)
 and improved seeds (hybrids or OPVs) by women who decided individually
 upon using the specified inputs, by female and male co-heads who jointly
 decided upon using those inputs, and by men who individually decided upon
 using those inputs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we examine the effect of involving women in receiving information,
 alone or as part of the couple.
 Results (Table 7, Model 1, Panel a) show a positive and significant increase
 of women’s input use index by 0.08.
 The effect of providing only female co-heads with information as opposed
 to only male co-heads (as in , Model 1A) is an increase of the women’s
 input use index by 0.13 and is based on an increase of the use of each of
 the listed inputs by women who decided individually upon their use (Table
 7, Model 1A, Panel a).
 In contrast, providing the female co-heads together with their male co-heads
 with information as opposed to only the male co-heads (as in , Model 1B)
 has no effect on women’s input use index (Appendix Table 7A, Model 1B,
 Panel a).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we examine the effects of involving women in receiving information,
 alone or as part of the couple, on joint input-use outcomes.
 Results (Table 7, Model 1, Panel b) show a positive and significant effect
 on the joint input use index, which is increased by 0.06.
 Providing only female co-heads with information as opposed to only male
 co-heads ( Model 1A) increases the joint input use index by 0.04 (Table
 7, Model 1A, Panel b).
 Providing female co-heads and their male co-heads with information as opposed
 to only the male co-heads (as in , Model 1B) increases the joint input
 use index by 0.09 (Appendix Table 7A, Model 1B, Panel b).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of involving women in receiving information, alone or as part
 of the couple, on input use decided upon by men is mixed: it is negative
 for the use of the fertilizer DAP and positive for organic fertilizer (,
 Model 1; Appendix Table 7B, Model 1).
 The negative effect on men’s decided-upon use of DAP emerges when the female
 co-heads receive the information alone (, Model 1A; Appendix Table 7B,
 Model 1A), which may be linked to men lacking information about the use
 of DAP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We continue by examining role-model effects with the comparison illustrated
 in , Model 2.
 Involving women in conveying extension information has a positive and significa
nt effect of 2 pp on the use of organic fertilizer by women who individually
 made the decision about its use (Table 7, Model 2, Panel a).
 There are also indications of positive effects on women’s decided-upon
 use of OPVs and the women’s input use index.
 The estimated effects have p-values lower than 0.10 but are not significant
 according to FWER consistent significance thresholds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Involving women in conveying the information has no significant effects
 on joint input use (Table 7, Model 2, Panel b).
 Yet there are indications that jointly decided-upon use of urea increased
 by 2 pp as a result of female co-heads having seen the video with a female
 actor (alone or with a male co-actor) instead of the video with only a
 male actor (as in , Model 2A) (Appendix Table 7A, Model 2A, Panel b).
 The use of DAP individually decided upon by men, however, seems negatively
 affected by that treatment (Appendix, Table 7B, Model 2A).
 There are indications that the use of both urea and hybrid seed individually
 decided upon by men are positively affected as a result of showing male
 co-heads the video with a female actor (alone or with a male co-actor)
 instead of the video with only a male actor (Appendix Table 7B, Model 2B).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Production and productivity 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we assess effects on production and productivity of female-managed
 maize plots as a result of involving women in receiving information versus
 only targeting the man (as illustrated in , Model 1).
 The results (Table 8, Model 1, Panel a) show a significant and positive
 increase of the total area of female-managed maize plots in the household
 by 0.07 acres, an increase of the total amount of household maize produced
 on female-managed plots by 35.8 kg, and an increase of the yield on female-manag
ed maize plots by 50.4 kg/acre; and a 2 pp higher likelihood of a better-than-nor
mal yield.
 Both the share of household maize production and maize area under female
 management increased by 6 pp.
 The positive effects on production and productivity outcomes on female-managed
 plots that result from providing only the female co-head with information
 instead of the male co-head (as in , Model 1A) are even larger in magnitude
 (Table 8, Model 1A, Panel a).
 In contrast, involving the female co-head as part of a couple receiving
 the information instead of only the male co-head (as in , Model 1B) shows
 no effect on production and productivity outcomes on female-managed plots
 (Appendix Table 8A, Model 1B, Panel a).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Involving women in receiving information, however, does not have any effect
 on production and productivity outcomes on jointly managed plots (Table
 8 ,Model 1, Panel b).
 Even when the female and male co-heads received the information together
 (as in , Model 1B), there is no impact on production and productivity outcomes
 on jointly managed plots (Appendix, Table 8A, Model 1B, Panel b).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we examine the effect of involving women in conveying the information
 rather than only a man (as in , Model 2) on production and productivity
 outcomes of female-managed plots.
 Results (Table 8, Model 2, Panel a) point to a significant and negative
 effect on the yield on female-managed plots.
 Suggestive indications of the negative effects on yield on female-managed
 plots emerge both when female co-heads and when male co-heads have seen
 the video featuring a female actor (alone or with a male co-actor) instead
 of the video featuring only a male actor (respectively Model 2A and Model
 2B in ).
 In the latter case, there are also indications of a negative effect on
 production on female-managed plots (Appendix Table 8A, Model 2A, Panel
 a and Model 2B, Panel a).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no evidence that production and productivity outcomes of jointly
 managed plots changed as a result of involving women in conveying the informati
on (alone or with a male co-actor) rather than only a man (as in Table 2,
 Model 2) (Table 8, Model 2, Panel b).
 However, both as a result of showing female co-heads and as result of showing
 male co-heads the video featuring a female actor (alone or with a male
 co-actor) instead of the video with only a male actor (respectively, Model
 2A and Model 2B in Table 2), the likelihood that the yield on jointly managed
 plots is better than normal is (indicatively) increased by about 4 pp.
 This translates into about a 40 percent increase over the mean of the control
 (Appendix Table 8A, Model 2A, Panel b and Model 2B, Panel b).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sales 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maize produced in the household independently sold by the female co-head
 is not affected by involving women in receiving information, alone or as
 part of the couple ( Model 1; Error: Reference source not found, Model
 1, Panel a).
 Yet providing the information to only the female co-head as opposed to
 providing it to only the male co-head (as in , Model 1A) increases the
 likelihood that she independently sells maize by 4 pp (Error: Reference
 source not found, Model 1A, Panel a).
 As few women in the control group actually sell maize independently, this
 translates into a substantial percentage increase of 46 percent over the
 mean of the control.
 There are indications of a positive effect on the amount of maize sold
 independently by women as well.
 The selling of maize by the female and male co-head jointly does not change
 by involving women in receiving information, alone or as part of the couple
 ( Model 1; Table 9, Model 1, Panel b).
 Neither does the selling of maize individually by the male co-head (Appendix
 Error: Reference source not foundB, Model 1).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we look into the effect of involving women in conveying information
 (by making the comparison visualized in , Model 2).
 Results (Table 9, Model 2, Panel a) show a significant and negative effect
 on the amount of maize that women independently sell.
 There are indications of negative effects on the likelihood and the amount
 sold independently by women when male co-heads view the video featuring
 a female actor (alone or with a male co-actor) delivering the information
 instead of only a male actor (as in , Model 2B) (Appendix Table 9A, Model
 2B, Panel a).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Involving women in conveying information has a positive effect of 4 pp (though
 just under the FWER-consistent significance threshold) on the likelihood
 that maize produced in the household is jointly sold.
 This translates into a 12 percent increase over the mean of the control
 (Table 9, Model 2, Panel b).
 An indication of a similar positive role model effect on joint sales emerges
 when women are involved in conveying information given to the female co-heads
 alone (Table 9, Model 2A, Panel b).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The amount of maize independently sold by men, however, is significantly
 and negatively affected by involving women in conveying information (Appendix
 Table 9B, Model 2).
 This seems particularly the case when female co-heads alone viewed the
 video in which women are involved in conveying information ( Model 2A;
 Appendix Table 9B, Model 2A), and seems unrelated to challenging role incongrui
ty among men since significant effects are absent in that case (, Model
 2B; Appendix Table 9B, Model 2B).

\begin_layout Standard
The results described above add nuance to prior studies that examine the
 role of gender in agricultural extension and technology adoption.
 To summarize these nuances, we provide an overview of the effects of different
 treatments on outcomes for women and for women jointly with their spouses
 in Table 10.
 As the withdrawal of men from individual decision-making may be empowering
 for women as well, we also included treatment effects on men’s outcomes
 where relevant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Women’s access to information and extension services 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Involving women in receiving extension information instead of giving it
 to only the male co-head has positive effects on women’s individual knowledge.
 As gains are made by giving women access to information directly, we can
 infer that male co-heads do not necessarily pass the information to their
 female co-heads.
 Women’s knowledge gains do not differ when a woman saw the extension video
 alone or when she saw it together with her male co-head, hence the presence
 of the male spouse in the exposure process apparently does not influence
 her knowledge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Joint knowledge, however, does not benefit from providing women with direct
 access to information, not even when the two co-heads in the household
 receive it.
 Thus, we offer no evidence of a change in intra-household information flows
 between spouses as a result of the treatment.
 The fact that men’s knowledge, particularly knowledge about new information,
 is negatively affected by giving the information to the female co-head
 alone, corroborates the finding that female co-heads do not necessarily
 share information with their spouse either.
 Somewhat surprisingly, men’s knowledge also seemingly decreases when he
 receives the information together with his female co-head versus when he
 receives it alone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Women gain individual agricultural decision-making when they are involved
 in receiving extension information, particularly when they receive it alone.
 Joint decision-making, however, remains unchanged.
 These results suggest that women’s agency in the domain of agriculture
 gains footing vis-à-vis men’s by the reduction of information asymmetries
 between the two co-heads in the household.
 This may follow directly from her access to the required information for
 making a decision, or, indirectly, from a gain in bargaining power based
 on her—albeit unique—access to information.
 Conversely, men’s individual decision-making is reduced as a result of
 involving women in receiving information, no matter if this happens by
 reaching the female co-head alone or together with the male co-head.
 If this reduction only occurred in the former case, men’s reduced decision-maki
ng could have been related to a lack of information.
 The fact that the reduction occurs in both cases suggest that men’s individual
 decision-making does not only decrease by not having direct access to informati
on but also because of women’s increased access to information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond women’s decision-making, the adoption of recommended practices and
 use of inputs individually decided upon by women is also positively affected
 by providing women with information.
 Hence, women seem to use their increased agency as a result of reduced
 intra-household information asymmetries to become more involved in farm-related
 activities.
 Additionally, the adoption of recommended practices and use of inputs jointly
 decided upon by the female and male co-head increases as a result of involving
 women in receiving information.
 This implies that informed women can also participate more in joint action.
 The positive effect on jointly decided adoption of recommended practices
 and inputs when the female and male co-heads receive the information together
 is consistent with Lambrecht et al.
 (2016) who found a positive impact of joint participation in an extension
 program on fertilizer adoption on jointly (and men-) managed plots.
 In parallel with decision-making, the adoption of recommended practices
 and use of inputs individually decided upon by men is negatively affected
 by providing women with information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result of providing only women with information, the total area of
 maize plots in the household managed by women increases and maize production
 on female-managed plots more than doubles.
 While increased women’s decision-making about and adoption of each of the
 five recommended practices does not mean these all occurred on maize plots
 under female management (as the term is defined here), there is, however,
 an obvious positive correlation.
 We can thus infer that the increased decision-making about and adoption
 of recommended practices and inputs by women as a result of solely involving
 women as information recipients paid off in higher production, increased
 area, and higher productivity on female-managed maize plots.
 In contrast, providing the information to the female and male co-head together
 did not make a change for area, production and productivity of female-managed
 maize plots.
 This probably relates to the fact that providing the information to the
 female and male co-head together does not have the same strong positive
 effects on women’s individual agency as providing the information to only
 the woman.
 Her lack of a unique possession of an informational asset seems to be in
 the way of capitalizing on her gain of information.
 There is no evidence of an increase of maize production, productivity,
 or area under cultivation under joint management as result of involving
 women in receiving information either, not even when the female and male
 co-heads were reached together.
 While we can also assume a positive correlation between joint decision-making
 and adoption and the likelihood that it concerns jointly managed plots
 (as defined here), we cannot infer that increased joint decision-making
 and adoption as a result of the female and male co-head receiving the informati
on together paid off in higher production and productivity on jointly managed
 maize plots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Women are also more likely to sell (more) maize independently if they alone
 received the extension information instead of the male co-head.
 At the same time, sales of maize individually by men is less likely, which
 indicates that women’s increased agency as a result of unique access to
 information reduces men’s dominance over maize sales.
 Giving the information to the female and male co-head together does not
 affect women’s (nor men’s) individual sales of maize.
 Joint sales of maize remain unaffected by involving women receiving information
, even as part of a couple.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that achievements in terms of production and sales by women individuall
y when the information is given to the couple are absent whereas women can
 individually achieve gains in production and sales if they receive the
 information alone suggests that a woman’s monopoly over information is
 essential for her individual achievements.
 Without that monopoly she seemingly cannot attain individual achievements.
 The fact that giving the information to the couple instead of only the
 male co-head increased women’s agency in terms of joint decision-making
 and adoption but not joint achievement implies that, despite women’s greater
 (joint) agency, these joint achievement are not different from what men
 individually achieve.
 This may be explained by the fact that the male co-head is involved in
 receiving the information in both cases, but it implies that women’s greater
 involvement in joint decision-making and action did not lead to greater
 joint achievements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lingering question is the extent to which the increased efforts by women
 that result from exclusively giving them extension information, in terms
 of applying the recommended practices and inputs and larger areas of maize
 cultivation under their management, augment their work burden (see 5.3.,
 5.4., and 5.5).
 Indeed, we observe that the time women spent on preparing fields and weeding
 went up by 1.4 and 3.3 person-days/maize season, respectively, as a result
 of providing only the female co-head, instead of only the male co-head,
 with information.
 This increase in women’s labor relates to the fact that women mainly apply
 labor-based intensification practices, which are likely more accessible
 to women than capital intensive practices such as the use of improved seeds
 or fertilizer.
 This suggests the need for further research on the labor and drudgery implicati
ons of these outcomes and the need to reflect upon making less labor-intensive
 intensification practices accessible to women.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Role-model effects 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We expected that including women in the extension information videos portrayed
 as farmers, whom viewers can relate to and who become successful by applying
 the practices shown in the video, would have had role-model effects and
 improve women’s outcomes.
 The evidence, however, is mixed.
 There is no impact on women’s knowledge of agronomic practices, nor on
 women’s individual decision-making and adoption of recommended practices,
 and indications of a negative effect on the yield on female-managed plots
 and sales of maize by women.
 Maybe not coincidentally, one of the limited positive role-model effects
 is on the use of organic fertilizer decided upon by women, which is a productiv
ity-enhancing input that may be directly available to a woman and which
 she does not need to bargain for.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are no effects of involving women in conveying information on joint
 outcomes, except for an indication that jointly selling maize has become
 more likely.
 The lack of effects on joint decision-making and adoption means that couples
 nor men were inspired to accept a greater participation of women in those
 decisions.
 There are, however, negative effects on men’s individual decision-making,
 as well as on the amount of maize independently sold by men, which may
 make way for more involvement of women in decision-making and action.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zooming in to role-model effects among female co-heads who viewed the extension
 information videos with women involved as messengers alone paints a slightly
 different picture.
 If women were the sole recipients of information provided by women, women’s
 individual decision-making increased as well as women’s individually decided-up
on adoption of the appropriate timing for planting maize and use of organic
 fertilizer - again practices that are available to a woman at no or limited
 cost.
 Yet, the indication of a negative effect on yield on female-managed plots
 emerges in this case as well.
 There are some indications of positive effects on joint outcomes, such
 as use of fertilizer, improved yields on jointly managed plots and a higher
 likelihood of jointly selling maize.
 The amount of maize sold independently by men seems to decrease as a result.
 The effects on joint and men’s outcomes of including women in the extension
 information videos shown to female co-heads as the sole recipients of the
 information seems to suggest that women who are inspired by the female
 role models not only gained individual agency but managed to make some
 changes at the couple level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effects of involving women in conveying information in the extension
 videos shown to male co-heads alone, which most likely mainly work through
 challenging role incongruity, seem to have reduced men’s individual decision-ma
king, particularly about whether to plant maize on a plot, men’s individually
 decided-upon adoption, and improve yield of jointly managed plots.
 These results suggest that role-model effects and challenging role incongruity
 among male co-heads may have encouraged them to dominate agricultural decision-
making less.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the literature, the effects of role models on success were mixed

\end_inset

.
 In this study they seem negative for women’s achievements about maize productiv
ity and sales.
 We believe there are three possible explanations for the decline in yield
 on female-managed plots as a result of role-model effects.
 First, the (indications of) increases in women’s decided-upon use of organic
 fertilizer and timely planting of maize may have been insufficient to generate
 positive changes in production and productivity outcomes on woman management
 plots – and, as the sole productivity-enhancing measures, may even have
 been counterproductive.
 Second, involving women in conveying information had negative effects on
 men individually deciding upon the planting of maize on the average household
 plot.
 Potentially, with men withdrawing from individually deciding to grow maize,
 women gained the opportunity to decide upon growing and focusing their
 efforts on other crops, which could explain a decline in women’s maize
 production and sales.
 The effects of role models on success rather emerge in joint outcomes,
 in terms of (indications of) improved yields on jointly managed plots and
 a greater likelihood of joint maize sales, and particularly when the female
 co-head was the only one receiving the information by women role models.
 Third, the literature is inconclusive about whether to expect strongest
 role-model effects among highly performing or highly aspiring people or
 among lowly performing or aspiring people.
 Involving women as role models in the extension videos may have had heterogeneo
us effects among women farmers with high and low aspirations, or among high-
 and low-performing women maize farmers.
 If such heterogeneous treatment effects exist and go in opposite directions,
 they could be a reason for the absence of significant effects and for seemingly
 overall negative effects.

Policy recommendations and conclusions

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper examines the extent to which the reduction of women’s extension
 information deficiency empowers women in agriculture and the extent to
 which information provided by women farmers as role models contributes
 to women’s empowerment in agriculture.
 To examine the effect of those two factors, a field experiment with a factorial
 design was run in eastern Uganda with monogamous smallholder maize farmers.
 The intervention consisted of a short video shown twice in which farmer-actors
 explain and demonstrate various strategies and practices to intensify the
 production of maize.
 Three versions were randomized across farming households: one version portrays
 a man farmer, another a woman farmer, the third a couple formed by man
 and woman farmers.
 Three constellations of recipients of information in the household were
 randomized as well: the male co-head alone, the female co-head alone, the
 male and female co-heads together.
 As such, we can assess (a) the impact of involving women as extension informati
on recipients, alone or as part of a couple, versus a man receiving information;
 and (b) the impact of involving women in conveying extension information,
 alone or as part of a couple, whereby these women can function as role
 models, versus a man giving information.
 We look at the impact on women’s knowledge about agronomic practices and
 joint knowledge of the male and female co-heads, women’s and joint decision-mak
ing about maize production, women’s and jointly decided-upon adoption of
 practices and use of inputs, production and productivity on women-managed
 maize plots and jointly managed maize plots in the households, and sales
 of maize independently by women and jointly by the male and female co-heads
 as indicators of women’s empowerment in agriculture.
 Additionally, we examine men’s outcomes in terms of knowledge, decision-making,
 adoption and input use, and maize sales where a reduction could imply the
 potential for greater involvement of women.

\begin_layout Standard
The findings of this study are largely consistent with other studies on
 gender and agriculture

.
 Yet, they give us pause for thought when we turn our attention to the role
 of ICTs in extension service provision.
 It is well-established that agricultural extension and rural advisory services
 tend to be male biased in both delivery and content, with predominantly
 male extension agents targeting male members of households with information
 that is often relevant to those crops, plots, or resources perceived to
 be under male control.
 And while there may be tacit—or even explicit—recognition that women play
 a significant role in agricultural production, a key assumption within
 extension practice is that men will share information with women within
 their household.
 In reality, men may have incentives to keep (part of this) information
 private.
 The results of this study clearly show that significant advances in women’s
 role in agriculture are made by giving women direct access to extension
 information.
 Furthermore, while the evidence is somewhat mixed, the results of this
 study suggest that women as role models, through peer effects, gender homophily
 effects, and/or challenges to role incongruity, influence women and men
 in different ways.
 Women are inspired to aspire when they receive information delivered by
 women but cannot turn that into individual success, in terms of yield and
 maize sales.
 The success emerges in joint outcomes.
 Men’s individual decision-making and agency, however, seems to reduce when
 men receive information delivered by women, which may create space for
 women’s participation in decision-making and action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three key policy recommendations follow from the results of this study.
 First, if the aim is to empower women by increasing their own agricultural
 knowledge, their independent decision-making, adoption of intensive production
 practices and, ultimately, to boost yields on plots that they autonomously
 manage, then there is considerable value in providing the necessary information
 directly to women.
 Second, if the aim is to empower women in collaboration with their male
 co-heads in the household, then providing information to female and male
 co-heads together can contribute to greater involvement of women in joint
 decision-making and joint action, but may not translate into better agricultura
l outcomes on jointly managed plots or increased joint sales.
 Besides, providing extension information to female and male co-heads together
 may not necessarily benefit women’s independent agricultural outcomes.
 Third, including women as role models may prove particularly useful to
 reduce men’s dominance in the domain of agriculture, which can create opportuni
ties for greater involvement of women.
 Including women as role models in information campaigns targeted at women
 can stimulate women’s individual decision-making and action and can engender
 improved joint production and sales.
 Care should be taken, however, to avoid negative impact on women’s individual
 production and sales.
 Facilitating women’s access to complementary inputs, including capital,
 may be needed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further research could explore the existence of heterogeneous treatment
 effects.
 Both video-based extension treatments may have had heterogeneous effects
 among women farmers with high and low aspirations, or among high- and low-perfo
rming women maize farmers.
 Heterogeneity that is linked to women’s relative bargaining power in their
 household, or to women’s (direct) access to complementary inputs needed
 for adoption, such as off-farm income or own capital, could exist as well.
 Finally, examining the effects of women’s direct access to extension informatio
n and role models complemented by improved access to complementary inputs
 on women’s empowerment in agriculture could answer questions about the
 role of such constraints to women’s achievements.
