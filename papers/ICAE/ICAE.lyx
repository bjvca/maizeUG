\begin_layout Title
The Role of Gender in ICT-mediated Agricultural Information Campaigns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\begin_layout Abstract
In agricultural information dissemination campaigns through agricultural
 advisory services, seemingly small design attributes, such as the way the
 information is delivered, who delivers the information, or who is targeted
 by the message, can result in significant differences in effectiveness
 and inclusiveness of the intervention.
 In the context of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) mediated
 knowledge transfer, this study investigates the importance of the gender
 composition of the person(s) who provide(s) the information and the gender
 composition of the person(s) who receive(s) the information.
 Our factorial design enables us to 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In particular, we set up a field experiment among smallholder maize farmers
 in Uganda to assess if reducing asymmetric information within the household
 leads to improved outcomes.
 In addition, we study the effectiveness of promoting a more cooperative
 approach to household farming.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Effectiveness is assessed in terms of knowledge gained, adoption of modern
 inputs and recommend practices, production and disposal, and well-being,
 and outcomes are dis-aggregated by gender to study changes in intra-household
 equity and women empowerment.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often, the poor appear to make sub-optimal decision because they lack critical
 pieces of information, fail to notice 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, or hold beliefs that are not true

key "doi:10.1162/qjec.2010.125.2.515,10.1257/app.3.1.1"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, in many instances, simple information campaigns designed to
 address these information inefficiencies can make a big difference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "banerjee2011poor"

\end_inset

.
 Also in the context of smallholder agriculture, it has been argued that
 a lack of information about the existence, use, and profitability of modern
 inputs and recommended practices is a major constraint to sustainable crop
 intensification 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 This, together with new possibilities offered through innovations in Informatio
n and Communication Technologies (ICT) has led to several initiatives aimed
 at revitalizing agricultural advisory services in developing countries.
 However, it has also been found that not all information campaigns are
 equally effective and that seemingly small design attributes such as the
 way the information is delivered, who delivers the information and who
 was targeted can make a big difference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper investigates gender related attributes that are thought to be
 key in effective and inclusive agricultural extension information delivery.
 In particular, we zoom in the the role of (i) the gender composition of
 the receiver(s) of the agricultural extension information messages and
 (ii) the gender composition of the messenger(s) of the information message.
 Together, particular combinations of these two attributes enable us to
 test three hypotheses.
 The first hypothesis is related to information asymmetries within the household
s, and we ask if it is more effective if both spouses within dual households
 receive the same information then if only one of them is given the information.
 The second hypothesis asserts that promoting a household cooperative approach
 to farming leads to better outcomes than when farming is framed as an idiosyncr
atic activity.
 Finally, a third hypothesis tests the existence of gender homophily in
 agricultural advisory services and investigates if information is more
 effective if comes from someone that is of the same gender than if it is
 provided by someone of the opposite sex.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The research hypotheses are tested using a field experiment, where farmers
 are randomly assigned to a group that receives a particular intervention,
 and their outcomes are compared to the outcomes of a group of farmers that
 did not receive this particular intervention 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2016field"

\end_inset

.
 As we want to test more than one research hypothesis and are particularly
 interested in comparing the relative effectiveness of various attributes
 of an ICT-mediated extension approach (instead of simply finding out what
 works and compare treatment to control groups), we opt for a factorial
 design.
 Generally, in such a design, a smaller sample size is needed to answer
 a fixed number of research questions as opposed to parallel designs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We work with maize farmers in eastern Uganda.
 The information interventions take the form of short videos that explain
 simple yet effective ways to increase maize productivity, such as best
 practices in row spacing and soil fertility management.
 To test hypotheses that depend on the gender composition of the person
 or persons targeted by the information, we show the video to either the
 man only, the woman only, or man and women together as a couple within
 dual households.
 To test hypotheses that depend on the gender composition the person or
 persons providing the information, we produced different versions of the
 video.
 In one version of the video, the information is provided by a male farmer.
 In a second version of the video, the same information is provided by a
 woman farmer.
 Finally, in a third version of the video, the information is given by a
 couple.
 Power calculations suggested we needed a sample of about 3,600 farmers,
 which was drawn from five districts.
 The videos were shown twice to farmers, once before the beginning of the
 main season, in July 2017, and once in the beginning of the season, in
 August 2017.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current version of this paper shows some initial results from this ongoing
 study.
 For instance, we have already established that the intervention is effective
 in transferring information: farmers that are shown a video are significantly
 more likely to select the correct answer from a set of alternative answers
 to a question.
 We also find that the information is more effective if the couple is targeted.
 An endline survey is planed in January 2018.
 As such, we will be able to assess outcomes further down the causal chain,
 such as whether the interventions also affect adoption of modern technologies
 and recommended practice, which in turn are expected to increase yields
 and well-being.

Research Questions and Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agricultural extension information services are generally biased toward
 men.
 Most often, extension officers are male who target the main decision maker
 with respect to agriculture within households, which is also often assumed
 to be the male farmer.
 The assumption that extension messages targeting one household member will
 trickle down to the rest of the household, including women and younger
 household members, may be false.
 Men do not necessarily discuss production decisions or transfer extension
 knowledge to women household members, especially if extension messages
 focus on menâ€™s priorities and crops 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fletschner2011gender"

\end_inset

.
 Gender homophily effects, where men learn more from other men and women
 learn more from other women, have also been reported in the context of
 agricultural extension services 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doss200127"

\end_inset

.
 At the same time, farms are essentially run and managed at the household
 level, and it may therefore be more effective if information is both provided
 and targeted at this level.
 The analysis of a Digital Green project in Ethiopia also concluded that
 there is much to be learned from observing the interactions between men
 and women who learn about the same technologies and practices

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we investigate the relative importance of (i) the gender
 composition of the messenger(s), and (ii) the gender composition of the
 audience for effective and inclusive agricultural extension information
 delivery to encourage sustainable crop intensification in smallholder household
 farms and for improving gender equity in household farming.
 By comparing groups of farmers where the messenger - recipient combinations
 differ, we can test a range of interesting hypotheses.
 In particular, our research is designed to answer three research questions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a first hypothesis, we will test if information is more effective if
 it is targeted to the couple within the household, instead of to an individual.
 It is related to the existence of asymmetric information within the household,
 which may lead to a sub-optimal intra-household allocation of productive
 resources and intensification investments.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "kabunga2012heterogeneous"

\end_inset

 find that female farmers are less likely to adopt tissue banana culture
 technology in Kenya, but that they would have an equal chance to adopt
 innovations, provided that they acquire sufficient knowledge about the
 innovation.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1093/erae/jbv039"

\end_inset

 investigate the effect of participating in extension training as a couple.
 They investigate whether participation of female farmers in an agricultural
 extension programme in South-Kivu increases adoption of three technologies:
 improved legume varieties, row planting and mineral fertilizer.
 In their study, joint male and female programme participation leads to
 the highest adoption rates.
 Knowledge may also affect technology adoption and subsequent yields through
 changes in relative bargaining power of the actors.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Doss200127"

\end_inset

 find that adoption of agricultural technologies among female farmers is
 lower than among male farmers.
 They find that this is due to gender-linked differences in access to complement
ary inputs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second hypothesis we will test is whether bringing the messages as a couple
 leads to better outcomes than when the information is given by an individual.
 This hypothesis is based on the assumption that social norms prevent women
 from playing a more prominent role in household agriculture.
 Gender stereotyping, where women are expected to tend to small gardens
 used to produce for home consumption and men are responsible for cash crops
 using inputs obtained from the market, may contribute to inefficient allocation
 of resources within the household as a single unit of production.
 Research on how information campaigns can be used to change beliefs, norms
 and perceptions has been ongoing in pubic health and has only recently
 started to trickle through to other disciplines.
 Encouraging results emerge with respect to the importance of role models

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a third hypothesis, we will test if matching the gender of the recipient
 with the gender of the messenger leads to better outcomes.
 Homophily effects, documented in a variety of social interactions, presume
 people learn more from people they can relate to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In Mozambique, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:78:y:2016:i:c:p:436-449"

\end_inset

 find evidence of such a gender-matching or homophily effect in extension,
 whereby women seem to learn more from fellow women and men seem to learn
 more from fellow men.
 In particular, they find that among men who received information about
 pit planting from a male messenger, the proportion that are aware of pit
 planting is 10 percentage points higher.
 Female awareness, knowledge and adoption is the same irrespective of the
 presence of a male extension worker.
 However, if a female extension worker is added, awareness, knowledge and
 adoption among female farmers also increases by roughly the same proportions.

Experimental Design and Corresponding Sampling Frame
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three hypotheses, in addition to the overall effectiveness of the ICT
 mediated information intervention, will be tested with a field experiment.
 The experiment was implemented as 3 by 2 factorial design to which a control
 group was added.
 We define two different factors, each with three levels.
 The first factor corresponds to the person(s) who provide the message and
 has three levels (male, female, and couple).
 Similarly, the second factor corresponds to the person who receives the
 information message.
 This factor also has three levels (male, female, and couple).
 A separate control group receives no information.
 The design, together with the sample size in each cell, is illustrated
 in Figure

The design in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 allows us to test the three hypotheses outlined above, in addition to simply
 testing if the information intervention works.
 To test if the information campaign works, we simply compare the average
 outcome among farmers in the control group to the average outcome of farmers
 that received the information intervention, irrespective of who received
 the information and who provided the information.
 This is illustrated in Panel (A) of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypothesis-tests"

\end_inset

.
 To test if information is more effective if it is targeted to the couple
 instead of the individual within the household (and hence test the asymmetric
 information hypotheses), we compare households where the couple received
 the information (irrespective of who provided the information) to households
 where the information was given to an individual (again irrespective of
 who provided the information).
 This is shown in Panel (B) of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypothesis-tests"

\end_inset

.
 To test if projecting a household cooperative approach is more effective,
 we compare outcomes of farmers where the information was provided by a
 couple of farmers, irrespective of who within the household received the
 information, to outcomes of farmers where the information was provided
 by a single farmer, again irrespective of who received the information
 (Panel (C) in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypothesis-tests"

\end_inset

).
 Finally, the gender homophily hypothesis can be tested by comparing outcomes
 of farmers where the information was provided by a woman to a woman in
 the household and information was provided by a man to a man, to outcome
 of farmers where the messenger was a man and the recipient was a woman
 and farmers where the messenger was a woman and the recipient was a man

The sample size and its distribution over different treatment combinations
 was based on an elaborate series of power calculations.
 Instead of determining power analytically, we used simulation techniques.
 Simulation allows one to sample from actual data on outcome variables instead
 of from a theoretical distribution with an assumed mean and standard deviation,
 which is a much more intuitive way to think about statistical power.
 It is straightforward to build in flexibility, such as allowing for more
 than one treatment arm, or account for sampling design effects such as
 cluster sampling.
 Power calculations were based on two outcome variables, one that reflects
 efficiency at the household level (maize yield) and one that reflects inclusive
ness (the gender productivity gap, where women managed plots are farmed
 less extensively than male managed plots resulting in significantly lower
 yields), and sample size was determined for each of the three hypotheses
 above (plus the treatment versus control).
 As can be seen, the gender homophily hypothesis is the most stringent,
 as it is based on only 4 cells of the design in Figure

Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We ran the experiment among maize farmer in Uganda.
 Maize is widely consumed, yet its value to weight ratio is sufficiently
 high to also make it an important traded commodity.
 Therefore, increasing maize productivity at the farm household level has
 the potential to lead to improvements in both nutritional outcomes and
 income.
 Maize yields in Uganda are relatively low.
 While on-station trials report potential yields of about 1.6 metric tons
 per acre (improved varieties, no fertilizer used), according to Uganda
 National Household Survey 2005/06 data, average maize yields are much lower,
 at about 618 kg per acre for the main growing season of 2014.
 There is a lot of variation in yields, with the top 10 percent of best
 farmers getting yields in excess of 1.1 metric tons per acre.
 At the same time, the use of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer
 and modern technologies such as row planting is very low in Uganda.
 For example, use of inorganic fertilizer is on average only 2.4 kg of nutrient
 per acre per year, compared to Kenya (75 kg/ac); Rwanda (70 kg/ac); and
 Tanzania (15 kg/ac).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maize is especially important in the East.
 We sampled from five districts eastern Uganda known for their maize production:
 Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo and Namutumba.
 From this, we removed town councils and also two sub-counties that consisted
 of islands in lake Victoria.
 Our study population consists of maize farmers within this region
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In particular, given the subject of our study, we target monogamous dual
 households that are growing maize.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Because of cost considerations, however, we used two-stage cluster sampling
 to obtain a representative sample of this population.
 In particular, we first randomly selected parishes (proportional to the
 number of villages within each parish).
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all the households, from which we then
 sampled households to be included in the study.
 At the same time, we suspect that outcomes within villages will be correlated,
 for instance due to local weather conditions, or development programs that
 are implemented in certain areas.
 We therefore used the village as a blocking factor.
 In other words, in each village, we made sure all possible treatment combinatio
ns related to the 2 factors (plus control) are administered.
 The experimental design described above shows that the messenger and the
 recipient factor combine into 9 different treatment combinations.
 Adding the control leads to 10 different households being selected in each
 village.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the East, there are two maize cropping seasons.
 For our study, we concentrated on the second maize growing season, which
 runs from about August to January.
 In August, fields are prepared and planting is done in September.
 First weeding happens around the end of September or the beginning of October.
 By late October, a second round of weeding takes place as maize starts
 to flower.
 Mid to late December, harvesting starts.
 In higher areas, harvesting can go on until mid January.
 During the second season, farmers prefer early maturing varieties, as the
 rains are short.
 However, in general, early maturing varieties have lower yields.
 The full cycle from planting to harvesting in lowland areas takes about
 3 to 3.5 months.
 In high altitude areas this can take up to 5 months.
 In our study, we concentrate on lowland areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Interventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information interventions are implemented as videos that were shown
 using 10 inch Android tablet computers.
 In accordance with the first factor in our factorial designs (to be able
 to vary the gender composition of the person(s) who provide the agricultural
 extension information) three videos were produced: one where the information
 was provided by a male farmer, one where the information was provided by
 a female farmers, and one where the information was provided by a couple
 (man+woman).
 Apart from varying this attribute of the treatment, the rest was exactly
 the same in the three videos.
 These videos were then shown to farmers according the second factor in
 the factorial design (related to who receives the information).
 In particular, in part of the sample, the video was shown to only the man
 within the household.
 In another part the video was shown to the woman within the household.
 In a final subgroup of the sample, it was shown to the couple together.
 The control group receives a placebo treatment.
 They got to see a music video with a traditional dance that has no information
 related to farming.
 Videos were shown twice to each farmer in the sample, once before planing
 (July 2017) and once immediately after planting (August 2017).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The treatments consist of the provision of information that is assumed to
 increase maize productivity through encouraging adoption of modern technologies
 and recommended practices.
 The goal was to select those practices and technologies that are likely
 to have the largest impact on yield, household income and intra-household
 equity.
 The topics to be included in the video script were obtained from interviews
 with key stakeholder and experts, such as maize farmers, value chain actors,
 maize seed breeders, extension workers and other government staff such
 as the district agricultural officer.
 These interviews took place in May 2017.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main factors affecting maize productivity are related to pests, poor
 soils, and poor seed quality.
 The three most important 
\series bold
pests
\series default
 that affect maize farming are Striga, maize stalk borer, and now also Fall
 Armyworm.
 We choose to focus on striga, as maize stalk borer seemed less problematic
 and at the time of the research, there was no consistent strategy to address
 Fall Armyworm.
 Striga (in particular the 
\emph on
Striga hermonihica
\emph default
 variety), also called whichweed, is a parasitic plant that feeds off the
 roots of maize.
 Doing so, it starts to draw nutrients from the host, leading to severe
 stunting of the host crop.
 As maize needs most nutrition at early stages of growth, weeding becomes
 less effective over time.
 In addition, each striga plant produces up to 50,000 seeds, which can remain
 dormant in the soil for a very long time.
 Striga can reduce production from about 30 percent up to total loss of
 the crop.
 No single method is effective to control striga.
 A new hybrid seed called Longe 7 HR, boosted with a herbicide, is said
 to be less affected by striga, but it is expensive at 10,000 Ugandan Shillings
 (UGX) per kg and does poorly under dry conditions and in areas where the
 rains are short such as in the East
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the East, early maturing varieties are preferred, such as Longe 10.
 In the future, a similar HR strain of Longe 10 is expected to be released.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Crop rotation with sweet potato or beans can reduce striga infestation.
 Furthermore, (additional) inorganic fertilizer use has also been recommended
 to counter striga.
 It has been observed that striga proliferates when soils are poor.
 In addition, one can make up for the nutrients drained by the parasite
 by boosting the maize plant with DAP or NPK.
 Weeding, especially the first time the striga comes up before it has had
 the chance to dig into the roots of the maize, is recommended, also to
 reduce the spread of seeds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Poor soils
\series default
, exhausted by continuous cultivation with little rotation, is the second
 main limiting factor.
 Soils lack macro-nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium
 (K).
 Farmers rarely use organic fertilizer.
 Experts say it is virtually impossible to get decent yields without using
 inorganic fertilizer.
 In particular, at planting stage, DAP or NPK should be used in the soil.
 After about 4 weeks, a nitrogen based fertilizer such as Urea should be
 applied on the topsoil near the plants to boost vegetation.
 Sometimes it is also advised to split the application of urea, administering
 half a doze at 4 weeks and half a dose at tasseling stage.
 Fertilizer can easily double yields.
 Especially used in combination with improved seeds, the effects of fertilizer
 are significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, farmers mainly rely on saved 
\series bold
seeds
\series default
, and maize in Eastern Uganda is no exception 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 However, as maize is cross pollinated, recycling leads to fast degeneration.
 Hybrid seeds such as Longe 7, Longe 9 are available and have also been
 distributed through Operation Wealth Creation.
 Hybird seeds potentially triple yields.
 In addition to hybrid seeds, which need to be procured every seasons as
 they can not be recycled, the government also released Open Pollinated
 Varieties (OPV).
 These are improved varieties that can be reused for about 3 or 4 seasons.
 In general, they are lower yielding than hybrid seeds.
 Still, yield are likely to be about 30 to 40 percent higher than when saved
 seeds are used, up to 100 percent if OPVs are also used with fertilizer.
 OPVs are generally recommended to poorer farmers as they can be reused
 as seeds to some extent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most hybrid seeds take long to mature.
 Farmers also complain that hybrids do not withstand drought very well.
 However, new varieties have entered the market that are both high yielding
 and early maturing.
 For example, UH5354, marketed as Bazooka, yields about 20 percent more
 than other hybrids and is drought resistant.
 Farmers that use these seeds report up to 40 bags of maize per acre
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Today, yields are about 7-8 bags per acre.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Similarly, there are several OPVs on the market that are also early maturing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, there are also 
\series bold
agricultural practices
\series default
 that affect yields, but the effects are generally smaller than those related
 to improved seeds and inorganic fertilizer use.
 The most important are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Timely planting
\series default
: maize should be planted at the onset of the rains.
 However, many farmers delay planting for several reasons.
 For instance, they may not be certain that the rains have really started.
 There may also be bottlenecks in land preparation, where the poor are often
 the last in line for the use of oxen or tractors.
 Experts estimate that for each day a farmer delays planting, yields are
 reduced by 1.5 percent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Plant spacing
\series default
: Plant that are too close to each other compete for light and nutrients,
 reducing yields.
 Plants that are to far from each other means space is wasted, also leading
 to lower yields.
 Related is the number of seeds that farmer plant in each hill.
 Farmers want to be sure of germination and put more than one seed, sometimes
 up to 5.
 If they all germinate, there is competition for nutrients and sun.
 Usually there is also not enough thinning, or this is done too late when
 competition has already occurred.
 One expert told us that standard spacing is 75cm x 60cm with two plants
 per hill.
 However, several experts mentioned a new way of plant spacing of 75cm x
 30cm with 1 plant per hill which leads to a 35 percent increase in yields.

Weeding
\series default
: The first weeding should be at 18-20 days after planting at the three
 leaf stage, and the second weeding at 2-3 weeks after first weeding.
 From emergence to 8 leave stage (knee height), the maize plant is a very
 poor competitor and unwanted stress such as weed competition must be prevented.
 Weeding must therefore be done within that period.
 A third weeding is optional.
 It is only dependent on weed pressure after the second weed.
 If needed, it should be done at tasseling stage.
 Weeding removing Striga at early stage before it can attach to the roots
 of the maize can also have a significant impact on yields.
 In addition, removing striga before it flowers reduces the spread of the
 pest.
 Proper weeding can increase yield by about 50 to 70 percent.

Farmers indeed often mention they do not use modern inputs because they
 have no money, suggesting liquidity is the main constraining factor, and
 thus instead of providing information, a more effective strategy would
 be to provide credit or subsidize inputs.
 Recent research, however, finds that despite what farmers claim, liquidity
 is often not the most important constraining factor.

 While for some households, the combination of particular household specific
 market failures and heterogeneity in the production function may mean adoption
 is not profitable, we feel that in many cases the returns to the investment
 as perceived by the farmer may not correspond well to actual returns.
 Investments in agricultural inputs or technologies require the farmer to
 compare costs today to a stream of uncertain future incomes.
 However, farmers may not have precise information about fixed and variable
 costs involved, about the level and variability of the stream of future
 income, or about the time frame.
 Inter-temporal decision making requires a long run perspective, and concepts
 such as compounding may be poorly understood by subsistence farmers

 talks about how he used to struggle with his maize gardens and how at one
 point in time, he decided things needed to change.
 It is shown how the farmer sells a hen, and obtains a small loan from a
 friend.
 This money is than used to buy small quantities of improved seed and fertilizer
 in a local shop.
 It is then shown that, before planting the improved seed, the farmer prepares
 the garden.
 He is shown collecting manure and applying it to a small corner of the
 field of 20m by 20m.
 Next, it is shown in detail how the maize seeds are spaced 75cm x 30cm
 with 1 plant per hill and how the DAP should be applied.
 The viewer is reminded to plant in time.
 The next scene depicts the field after about 10 to 12 days when the maize
 has emerged from the ground.
 At this stage, it is recommended that the farmer engages into gap filling
 to replace seeds that did not germinate with new seeds to preserve optimal
 plant density.
 The next shot shows the field at 18 to 20 days after planing, when first
 weeding is done.
 Particular attention is paid to identification of striga at an early stage.
 It is also advised to weed again two to three weeks later.
 The next scene zooms in on Urea fertilizer application.
 Here, the field is shown at about 4 weeks after planting when the maize
 is knee high.
 It is shown how Urea topsoil dressing should be applied.
 Finally, it is recommended to do one more round of weeding around the tasseling
 stage of the maize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then spend some time on the concept of investing now to get more yields
 over time.
 We point out that it may indeed be difficult to raise cash, but that the
 farmer can always start small (eg.
 on one tenth of an acre) and reinvest returns.
 It is explained that following recommended practices and using improved
 inputs led to 2.5 bags of maize on the small plot, which they sold for 125,000
 shillings, giving them a profit of almost 90,000 shillings.
 It is reminded that, if they had not used modern inputs or followed recommended
 practices, they would only have harvested one bag on that same area, and
 profit would be 40,000.
 It is further explained that they reinvested the difference between the
 profit they got and the profit they would have gotten without using inputs
 to increase the area under intensive maize cultivation year after year.
 Pretty soon, they are able to cultivate an entire acre using modern inputs.
 In the final part of the video, the farmer recapitulates and once more
 directly addresses the viewer to encourages him or her to try this as well.

While we did not do a dedicated baseline survey, we did ask some questions
 before the first intervention to investigate balance.
 The choice of variables was based on what variables other researchers in
 similar studies use in their orthogonality tests.
 In particular, we looked at balance tables in studies that investigate
 the adoption of yield improving methods and technologies using RCTs.

 In addition, we also add some variables that may be useful to investigate
 heterogeneity in treatment effects.
 In particular, we collect some household characteristics such as household
 size, age and education level of both wife and husband.
 We then ask more specific questions related to maize farming, such as acreage
 and quantities produced in the last season.
 Furthermore, we ask if the household received agricultural extension, whether
 improved maize seeds were used, and whether fertilizer was applied.
 We also collect data on housing conditions (material of wall and number
 of bedrooms) and access to off-farm income.

The table shows that few farmers that were included in our study had access
 to agricultural extension in the previous year.
 We also see that only about 20 percent of farmers reported to have used
 fertilizer in the previous maize growing season (April â€“ July 2017) and
 about 38 percent reported to have used improved seed bought from a shop
 or agro-input dealer during the last cropping season.
 This suggests ample scope to increase intensification investments through
 extension.
 We also find that farmers produced on average only 287 kg of maize per
 acre in the first cropping season of 2017.
 This is substantially lower than the average yield of 618 kg per acre we
 find when using the Uganda National Household Survey of 2005/06.
 The low yields illustrate the devastating impact of the Fall Armyworm that
 ravaged maize yields in East Africa in 2017

The table also shows some imbalance, particularly with respect to the asymmetric
 information hypothesis (H1), where farmers that were shown the video individual
ly are compared to farmers that received the information treatment as a
 couple.
 In particular, we find that households where the information was shown
 to a couple were significantly younger, and this difference is also reflected
 in other variables.
 For instance, the fact that they are younger apparently also means they
 have fewer children, are more likely to have used fertilizer in the previous
 growing season.
 They also seem less likely to have finished primary education.

We first tested the impact of the information intervention and the effect
 of changing the gender composition of the messenger and the recipient on
 knowledge.
 This was done through a short quiz consisting of four questions that was
 asked during endline to each of the two spouses individually.
 For each question, three possible answers were read out to the respondent,
 who was then asked to indicate what answer he or she though was correct.
 The respondent was also allowed to indicate he or she did not know what
 the correct answer was.
 The household was considered knowledgeable on a particular topic if at
 least one of the spouses indicated the correct answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first question was related to planting.
 In our video, we recommended a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with 1 plant per
 hill and this was the correct option among the alternatives.
 Other options were 75cm x 60cm with two plants per hill, which is standard
 for many farmers and recommended by most agricultural extension agents.
 We also added an intermediate alternative answer of of 75cm x 30cm with
 2 seeds per hill.
 As we recommend a technique that deviates from what is assumed to be standard
 spacing, we assume that the recommended practice is new to most of the
 farmers.
 The second question is less related to technical knowledge, but more to
 viewing farming as a business.
 In the video, we pay ample attention to promoting an approach where farmers
 start small and grow over time through reinvesting.
 We wanted to see if farmers internalize this advice and ask what a successful
 farmer should you do if you only have 40,000 shillings.
 The correct option was to use it to buy improved seed and fertilizer and
 start intensified farming on a small area.
 Alternative options were to: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 For the third questions, we asked when is weeding is most important.
 Weeding is most important during the first four weeks after planting, as
 maize is a poor competitor for light and nutrients.
 Alternative answers were:

 It is assumed that most farmers would know this.
 Finally, we also asked if farmers knew when spraying against the fall armyworm
 is most effective.
 There was no information given about fighting fall armyworm in the video,
 so unless seeing a video encourages farmers to search for additional informatio
n, we do not expect an impact from seeing a video.
 For this question, the correct option was:

, we compare results on the quiz between households that were allocated
 to the control group to the results of households that were shown a video,
 irrespective of who this video was shown to and who provided the information
 in the video.
 We find that in 16.4 percent of the households in the control group, at
 least one of the spouses could indicate the correct alternative among the
 response options to the question on what best spacing for maize seeds should
 be.
 The reason why this is relatively low is because this is a fairly new recommend
ation.
 We see that among households that were shown a video, the proportion increases
 by 13.2 percentage points, to almost 30 percent, and this difference is
 statistically significant.
 About 91.2 percent of households that were not shown the treatment video
 know that is best to combine inputs instead of only using seed or fertilizer.
 Even though baseline knowledge is already high, the video treatment further
 increased this knowledge by another 5.1 percentage points.
 We further see that in about 94.6 percent of households in the control group
 at least one of the spouses was able to correctly indicate that weeding
 is most important during the first 4 weeks after planting.
 Our pre-analysis plan specified that we would drop variables where 95 percent
 of outcomes are the same value to reduce the influence of outcomes with
 limited variation.
 In any case, the intervention does not seem to have a significant effect
 on this outcome.
 Finally, as expected, we do not find that households that were shown the
 video are more likely to know when one should spray against fall armyworm.
 Overall, and as confirmed by the knowledge index, we conclude that the

, now focuses only on households that received the video and, within that
 subgroup, differentiates between households where the video was shown to
 an individual (either the man or woman) and households where the video
 was shown to man and wife together.
 We find that among households where the video was shown to an individual,
 28 percent knew the recommended spacing, 95.6 percent knew inputs are best
 combined, 94.3 percent knew weeding during the first 4 weeks is critical,
 and 30.8 percent knew when to spay against fall armyworm.
 We do not find a significant differences between the two groups.
 The fact that there is no difference in learning from the videos depending
 on who was targeted is confirmed by the index.
 The third panel, indicated as Individual versus couple pictured, compares
 household level quiz scores between households where the person that featured
 in the video was an individual (man or woman) and households where the
 information in the video was given by a couple.
 Also here, we do not find significant differences in the proportions in
 the two groups.
 As such, at the household level, while showing a video increases knowledge,
 it does not seem to matter whether the couple is targeted or the video
 is shown to just one of the spouses.
 In addition, it does not seem to matter whether the information is provided
 by a couple or an individual.

 Table

 compares adoption rates for a range of technologies and practices between
 households in the control group and households that were shown a video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first recommended practice we look at is early planting, which was emphasize
d in the video.
 We find that in about 36.8 percent of households where the placebo video
 was shown, at least one spouse reports they have started planting maize
 within one day following the first rains.
 This seems to be not significantly different from the proportion of households
 that reported planting immediately after the rains among households that
 were given information through the video.
 We also carefully explain a novel way of planting, where spacing between
 hills in a row is reduced but only one seed is planted per hill instead
 of the usual two.
 We see that the percentage of households in which at least one of the spouses
 reports this new way of planting on at least one plot is only 3.2 percent
 among the control group.
 However, this percentage increases to 10 percent and the increase is significan
tly different from zero when households were shown the video.
 We find a similar positive impact from showing the video for the removal
 of striga according to the recommendations: in the control group, 70.4 percent
 of households report removing striga before it flowers to reduce damage
 early on and prevent the weed from spreading.
 Among farm households that were shown the video, this percentage is 5.8
 percentage points higher.
 We find that about 41 percent of control households report first weeding
 first after 18-20 days, which was what we recommended in the video.
 We do not find that this proportion is significantly higher among treated
 households.

We collected detailed information on fertilizer used on the maize plots.
 Overall, 47.9 percent of households in the control group reported they used
 fertilizer on at least one plot.
 While this percentage is almost 10 percent higher among treated farmers,
 the difference is not significant after correcting for multiple hypothesis
 testing
\begin_inset Note Note

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This can be explained by looking at the different types of fertilizer.
 We see that among the control group, already a substantial proportion of
 farmers is using DAP or NPK.
 This proportion is significantly lower among households that were shown
 the video.
 At the same time, the use of urea, as well as the use of organic fertilizer,
 seems to have increase in response to the information intervention.
 Urea use in particular, which was very low in the control group, almost
 doubled due to the video.
 Inorganic fertilizer increased from 19 percent to 26.5 percent.
 Most likely, this is due to the fact that, in the video, it is emphasized
 that inputs should be combined to get best results, and as a result some
 of the treated farmers reduce their use of DAP or NPK and increase adoption
 of Urea and inorganic fertilizer to engage in more balanced soil nutrient
 management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also collected detailed information on the use of improved seed on the
 maize plots.
 Improved seed is already relatively high, with 57.2 percent of households
 reporting to use either hybrid and/or open pollinated varieties on at least
 one maize plot.
 However, seed adoption rates remain constant after seeing the video.
 We also check if the proportion of households that combine improved seed
 with fertilizer increases after having seen the video.
 While the percentage of households that report using both technologies
 increases by more than 10 percent, this difference is not statistically
 significant.
 The proportion of households that buy seeds on the market, as opposed to
 recycling used seed, also is not affected by the information treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also want to see if our intervention crowds in other technologies or
 practices.
 While we do not promote the use of chemicals such as fungicides, pesticides
 or herbicides in our video, use rates may be indirectly affected.
 We find that about 43.2 percent of households uses chemicals on at least
 one plot.
 We indeed see that this is more than 11 percent higher in households that
 were shown the video.
 But also here, the difference is not statistically significant after adjusting
 for multiple hypothesis testing
\begin_inset Note Note

\end_inset

.
 Finally, we look if the video increases the likelihood that households
 hire in labour.
 While hiring in of labour seems common, the rate is not affected by the
 intervention.
 Overall, as in the case of knowledge, the agricultural information intervention
 seemed to increase adoption of a range of modern agricultural technologies
 and recommended farming practices, and this conclusion is supported by
 a significant positive impact of the videos on the agricultural adoption
 index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results for the second main hypothesis, where households where the video
 was shown to one of the spouses individually are contrasted with households
 where the video was shown to the couple, are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 The table shows that among households were videos were shown to either
 the man of the woman seperately, about 36.5 percent of households planted
 immediately after the first rains and 8.9 percent followed recommended spacing
 on at least one plot.
 We also see that about 73.8 percent of these households where the recipient
 of the information was the individual removed striga before flowering and
 engaged in weeding in the third week.
 For none of these practices, a significant difference between the two treatment
 groups can be detected: it seems to matter whether this information was
 given to an individual or a couple.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do find that targeting matters for fertilizer use.
 We find that about 47.5 percent of households where the video was shown
 to only one individual report using fertilizer on at least one plot.
 This percentage increases to 53 percent if the couple was targeted with
 the information.
 From further dis-aggregation of the fertilizer types, we learn that this
 difference is driven by organic fertilizer.
 Among households where the video was shown to only one of the spouses,
 about 22 percent reports to be using organic fertilizer on at least one
 plot.
 Among households where the video was shown to the couple, this percentage
 increases to 31.4 percent
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Can we explain this? Why would this be the case?
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, while we do not find a difference between the two groups in
 terms of the use of improved maize seed, we do see that households that
 received the information as a couple are more likely to combine fertilizer
 use with improved seed.
 We also see that the proportion of households that bought seed is higher
 among farmers where the video was shown the both spouses together, but
 the difference is not significant after adjusting for multiple hypothesis
 testing
\begin_inset Note Note

 As such, while the information provided thought the video seems more effective
 if targeted at the couple for some inputs and practices, this finding can
 not be generalized as is also evident from the fact that the adoption index
 does not significantly differ between the two groups.

Impact on production

\begin_layout Standard
We next turn to changes in production related outcome as a result of our
 experiment.
 We first look at household level maize production.
 During the endline survey, we asked both spouses separately to estimate
 how much maize was harvested from each plot.
 These quantities are then summed over the different plots for each spouse
 and the average between the two spouses are taken as the final estimate
 of household level maize production.
 We find that overall, a typical farm household in our sample produced about
 460 kgs of maize.
 Households produce this on 1.13 acres on average.
 Taken together, we find that yields, defined as kilograms per acre, amount
 to on average 470 kilograms per acre.
 This is much higer than yields recorded at baseline (290 kg/acre) as the
 rains were better and there was increased attention for strategies to combat
 fall armyworm.
 Still, compared to FAOSTAT figures (1000 kg/acre) or figures from household
 survey data (typically around 600 kg/acre), yields were below normal, as
 is also confirmed by the fact that in only 40 percent of households at
 least one spouse reports that yields were better than a typical year on
 at least one plot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:yield_ag_allh"

\end_inset

 reports results for the three hypotheses with respect to outcomes related
 to production.
 In the top panel we again compare outcomes of control households to outcomes
 of households where at least one individual was shown a video.
 Household level production, expressed in logs and trimmed 5 percent at
 each end of the distribution, does not differ between the two groups.
 We do find, however, that households that were exposed to the information
 seem to cultivate smaller plots: Reported acreage is 11 percent smaller
 among households that were shown a video.
 The fact that the same amount is cultivated on a smaller area also results
 in the fact that in households that were shown a video, yields are almost
 14 percent higher than in control households.
 Overall, we find that the information intervention had a significant and
 positive effect on production outcomes, as is evident from the positive
 treatment effect in the production index.
 We can conclude that at the household level, the videos thus seem to affect
 the intensification of maize.
 Again, this can be traced back to the fact that in the video, it is emphasized
 that it is better to combine inputs and practices, and that as such, it
 is often better to start small.
 In addition, the video promotes a more commercial attitude towards farming,
 where investments are made at a small scale to be scaled up over time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing production outcomes between households where the video was shown
 to only one individual and households where the video was shown to the
 couple, we find little impact.
 Similarly, we do not find that it matters for production whether the informatio
n was given by an individual or by a couple.

Impact on decision making

The aim of this study is to investigate if small changes in the design of
 agricultural extension messages can make The changes in intra-household
 decision making.
 In particular, we want to make agricultural advisory services more inclusive.

.
 Write here that this is especially the case for hypothesis 2 and 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the endline, we asked each spouse to describe what happens if they
 disagree about any maize related issue.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Agreement-about-maize"

\end_inset

 reports that about 41 percent of men in households where the video was
 not shown to the couple together will generally tell their wife they do
 not agree about any maize related issue.
 Showing the video to a couple instead of to an individual increases this
 by about 3.7 percentage points, but the difference is not statistically
 significant.
 Among households where only one of the spouses was shown a video, the likelihoo
d that the women will tell the husband that she disagrees is slightly lower
 at 38.3 percent.
 However, if the video is shown to the couple, there is a significant increase
 in this percentage.
 Combining these two answers, we construct an indicator that is true if
 both spouses indicate that they will generally tell the other if they do
 not agree about any maize related issue.
 We find that in households where recipients were individuals about 24.3
 percent of spouses tell each other if they disagree.
 Among households where the video was shown to the couple, this percentage
 increases to 28 percent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next compare households that have seen the video where information was
 given by either a man or a woman to households where information was provided
 by a couple.
 We see that in half of the households where the messenger was an individual,
 the man will tell the wife if he disagrees about any maize related issue.
 This percentage is significantly lower among households where the messenger
 was a couple
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Why? Do we have an explanation for this??? Could this maybe be that after
 seeing a couple in the video, the husband thinks the wife is entitled to
 her own opinion or her own way of doing things?
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Changing the messenger attribute does not seem to have an effect on the
 likelihood that the woman tells the husband that she does not agree.
 Among 49 percent of households where the version of the video was shown
 where an individual gives the information, both husband and wife indicate
 they will generally tell each other if they do not agree.
 This is 3.8 percentage points higher among households that were shown the
 version of the video where the information was given by a couple, but this
 difference is not significant that the 5 percent significance level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next question is a follow up question on the previous one and inquires
 about what happens when one of the spouses tells the other spouse that
 he or she disagrees.
 As such, this question was not asked to individuals that stated in the
 previous question that they did never tell their spouse if they disagree
 about maize related issues (281 men and 307 woman).
 As outcome, we compute the proportion of households in which the husband,
 the wife, or both respond that they talk and come to a conclusion that
 suits both, as opposed to situations in which the spouse either ignores
 the other or simply does what the other spouse orders.
 Results are in the lower panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Agreement-about-maize"

\end_inset

.
 We find that in 72 percent of households that have been shown the video
 at the individual level, the man will discuss issues with the wife if he
 does not agree and they will come to mutually satisfying solution.
 This percentage increases to 74.7 percent if the video was shown to a couple,
 but the increase is not significant.
 In 68 percent of households that have been shown the video at the individual
 level, the woman will discuss issues with the man if she does not agree
 and they will come to mutually satisfying solution.
 This proportion increases by almost 7 percent, to 72.5, if the video was
 shown to both spouses together.
 The likelihood that both spouses indicate that they talk and come to a
 common solution is almost 8 percent higher when the video is shown to a
 couple, but the difference is not significant.
 We do not find differences in spouses consulting each other conditional
 on who provided the information in the video.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a world characterized by incomplete and asymmetric information, targeted
 efforts to fill knowledge gaps can make a big difference

.
 However, not every information campaign is equally effective, and often,
 seemingly small attributes, such as the way a message is framed, how it
 is delivered, who is targeted by the message and who delivers the message,
 can result in significant differences in impact.
 Understanding and quantifying the importance of each of these design attributes
 through rigorous evaluation research should therefore be an essential part
 of any knowledge exchange model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Motivated by the observation that most agricultural advisory services are
 biased toward men, this study looked at two gender related attributes of
 an Information and Communication Technology mediated agricultural extension
 information campaign.
 The first attribute consists of the gender composition of the person or
 persons that provide the information.
 The second attribute is the gender composition of the person or persons
 to which the information is targeted.
 This allows us to test a range of hypotheses.
 We focus on three important hypothesis related to (1) information asymmetries
 within the household; (2) a cooperative approach to farming; and (3) gender
 homophily.
 In addition, we also test if the information intervention in itself is
 effective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The various hypotheses are tested using a field experiment where the messenger
 of the information and the recipient of the information is randomly altered
 according to a 3 by 2 factorial design.
 The study population were maize farmers in Eastern Uganda, from which we
 sampled about 3,600 farmers.
 The information treatments were implemented as short videos that were shown
 to the farmers on tablet computers.
 The videos showed how inputs and improved farming practices can be used
 to increase production.
 It also explains important concepts in inter-temporal decision making.
 The messages are also packaged in an attractive way, with role model farmers
 explaining how intensification of maize production improved their lives.
 The videos were shown twice, once just before the the planting season,
 and once early in the season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the information campaign increased knowledge about recommended
 agricultural practices and about how to invest in farming.
 Especially if the information is about a new technology and it can be assumed
 that previous knowledge is limited, we find big and persistent increases
 in knowledge that can be attributed to the intervention.
 We find that information about new technologies and practices are more
 effective in terms of knowledge creation if targeted to the couple, instead
 of an individual within the household.
 We do not find that farmers learn more from farmers that are from the same
 sex.
 We also do not find that farmers learn more if the information is brought
 by a couple as opposed to by either a man or a woman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that farmers appear to absorb the information provided through
 the video and that this happens more efficiently if the information is
 given to a couple is encouraging, as knowledge transfer is only the first
 link in the causal chain between information and outcomes.
 For instance, increased knowledge about proper spacing may lead farmers
 to also adopt the practice, resulting in higher yields and welfare more
 general.
 Especially if the couple was targeted, spouses may encourage each other
 to experiment, leading to higher rates of adoption and subsequent outcomes.
 The fact that we did not find knowledge effects for promoting a cooperative
 farming approach or for gender matching does not automatically mean there
 will be no impact on intermediate or final outcomes.
 For example behavior change may depend on whether you actually believe
 the information, which may be conditional on gender matching.
 To find out the impact of the intervention on intermediate and final outcomes,
 we first have to collect endline data, which is planned for February 2018.

\begin_layout Standard
Key results:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Farm households reduce use of DAP/NPK and increase use of urea and inorganic
 fertilizer.
 Most likely, this is due to the fact that, in the video, it is emphasized
 that inputs should be combined to get best results, and as a result some
 of the treated farmers reduce their use of DAP or NPK and increase adoption
 of Urea and inorganic fertilizer to engage in more balanced soil nutrient
 management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
while the information provided thought the video seems more effective if
 targeted at the couple for some inputs and practices, this finding can
 not be generalized as is also evident from the fact that the adoption index
 does not significantly differ between the two groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
despite the impact on production, we do not find any impact on welfare,
 either measured as consumption expenditure or self-assessed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We find no evidence of a couple role model effect.
