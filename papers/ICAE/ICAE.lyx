\begin_layout Title
The Role of Gender in ICT-mediated Agricultural Information Campaigns
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In programs to disseminate information through agricultural extension and
 advisory services, seemingly small design attributes—the way the information
 is delivered, who delivers the information, or who is targeted by the message—c
an result in significant differences in effectiveness and inclusiveness
 of the intervention.
 Information and communications technology (ICT) can reduce the costs associated
 with adapting design attributes to particular problems and contexts.
 This study investigates the impact of a video-mediated extension approach
 and the importance of the gender composition of the person(s) who provide(s)
 the information and the gender composition of the person(s) who receive(s)
 the information.
 We conduct a field experiment among smallholder maize farmers in Uganda
 to determine whether and how reductions in information asymmetries among
 and within households lead to a range of productivity- and welfare-improving
 outcomes.
 Specifically, we assess the effectiveness of the approach by measuring
 knowledge gained, adoption of modern inputs and recommend practices, maize
 production and disposal, and well-being.
 We assess the approach’s inclusivity by exploring gender-disaggregated
 effects on in intra-household decision-making, cooperative approaches to
 household farming, and other equity indicators.
 We find that short extension video messages increase knowledge, technology
 adoption, and production at the household level, especially when the informatio
n is targeted to both husband and wife as a couple.
 We also find that targeting the information to husband and wife jointly
 leads to a significant increase in joint decision-making.
 Most of these household level effects, however, work through male-managed
 and jointly-managed plots, and women seem less able to use the new information
 on plots they manage directly and independently.
 Furthermore, we find no evidence of homophily or role model effects resulting
 from short videos featuring farmer-actors who are similar to the farmers
 participating in the experiment.

Often, the poor appear to make sub-optimal decisions because they lack critical
 pieces of information, are unable to benefit from learning externalities

 In many instances, information campaigns, extension programs, or advisory
 services designed to address these information inefficiencies can lead
 to significant differences in an individual's decision-making 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In the context of smallholder agriculture, these inefficiencies have been
 well documented, especially where the lack of information about the existence,
 use, and profitability of modern inputs, improved technologies, and recommended
 management practices are a major constraint to sustainable crop intensification
, productivity growth, and food security

\begin_layout Standard
With new possibilities offered by information and communications technology
 (ICT), an abundance of pilot projects and commercial products have entered
 the market with a focus on revitalizing agricultural extension and advisory
 services in developing countries.
 However, a growing body of evidence suggests that not all ICT-mediated
 extension approaches are equally effective in achieving outcomes such as
 increased rates of technology adoption, higher crop yields, or improvements
 in household welfare and intra-household equity.
 Seemingly small design attributes—the way information is delivered, who
 delivers the information, and who was targeted—can significantly influence
 these outcomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper investigates the effectiveness of information about improved
 maize cultivation delivered to smallholder farmers in Uganda.
 In a first part, we consider the technology through which the information
 is delivered to the farmer, and differentiate between (i) short audiovisual
 messages viewed on tablet computers; (ii) Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
 systems that can be called upon if the need arises; and (iii) short message
 service (sms) nudges that remind farmers at particular points in time about
 key farming practices.
 The outcomes used to judge the relative effectiveness of the the difference
 technologies are generally aggregated to the household level and include
 knowledge gained, practices and and modern inputs adopted, farm production
 and disposal, and household well-being.
 In a second part, the paper further explores the role and importance of
 gender-related attributes in the design of the video-mediated approach
 that influence the inclusivity of extension information delivery.
 In particular, we focus on (i) the gender composition of the receiver(s)
 of extension messages and (ii) the gender composition of the messenger(s)
 of the information message.
 Experimental variations in these attributes allows us to test hypotheses
 related to information asymmetries within (dual) households.
 In addition, it allows us to test hypotheses related to the efficacy of
 videos containing illustrative and expositional content to change certain
 customs, beliefs or gender stereotypes related to maize farming 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A dual household is defined as a household containing both one male and
 one female member who take decisions as head of household either jointly
 or singly in their respective spheres of responsibility.
 It thus excludes single headed households or polygamous households.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The role of these gender related attributes is judged by looking at knowledge
 at the individual level, decision making within the households, as well
 as adoption and production outcomes conditional on who is the primary plot
 manager.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These hypotheses are tested using a field experiment in which farmers are
 randomly assigned to a group that receives a particular information interventio
n, and their outcomes are compared to the outcomes of a group of farmers
 that did not receive the information intervention 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2016field"

\end_inset

.
 As we want to test more than one research hypothesis and are particularly
 interested in comparing the relative effectiveness of various attributes
 of an ICT-mediated extension approach, we opt for a factorial design.
 Generally, in factorial designs, a smaller sample size is needed to answer
 a fixed number of research questions as opposed to parallel designs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We work with 3,600 participants sampled from the population of dual households
 cultivating maize across five districts of eastern Uganda.
 The core information interventions take the form of short videos that explain
 simple yet effective ways to increase maize productivity and profitability,
 such as best practices in row spacing, the importance of quality seed,
 optimal soil fertility management, and farm budget management.
 To test overall effectiveness of the information provided through the video,
 we compare outcomes of farmers that were exposed to a placebo video to
 outcomes of farmers that were shown the video.
 To about two third of the sample of farm households that were shown the
 agricultural information video, we also gave to toll free phone number
 and explained they could call this number any time if they needed more
 information on maize farming.
 Finally, to half of the sample of households that got the IVR number (and
 thus were also shown the video) we sent 10 sms messages at strategic points
 in time reminding them to about the importance of a particular technology
 or practice that was explained in the video and repeating that they can
 always call the IVR system if they want more information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test how information asymmetry within the household affects decision
 making and outcomes, we compare farm households where the video was shown
 only to the man in the household (the status quo) to households where the
 video was shown to the woman in the household, and to households where
 the video was shown to man and women together as a couple.
 To test the hypothesis on the importance of the gender (composition) of
 the person(s) providing the information, we produced different versions
 of the video.
 In each version of the video, the information was exactly the same, only
 the person (or persons) that featured in the video and explained everything
 was changed.
 In one version of the video, all the information is provided by an individual
 male farmer, while in a second version of the video, the information is
 given by a female farmer.
 In a third version of the video, the exact same information is given by
 a couple, each spouse taking turns in explaining things.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the farm household level, we find that providing information to farmers
 through short video messages increases their knowledge about modern inputs,
 improved technologies, and recommended practices.
 In addition, farmers who were shown the video are also more likely to adopt
 a range of inputs, technologies, and practices that were presented in the
 videos.
 We also find clear effects on production with maize yields 14 percent higher
 than in control households.
 However, these results do not translate into higher well-being.
 The IVR has no additional knowledge impact.
 The additional effect on technology adoption of IVR is also less significant:
 we only find a positive effect on the uptake of hybrid seed.
 Still, we do find that households that were allocated to the IVR treatment
 report yields that are 8 percent higher.
 The sms campaign has no additional impact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the household, we find greater nuance to these initial findings.
 First, the observed yield gains are observed on male- and jointly-managed
 plots: although we observe that providing information through the video
 messages increases women's involvement in decision making.
 However, the increase in participation in decision making does not translated
 into higher yields on women-managed plots.

\begin_layout Section*
Research Questions and Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of delivering agricultural
 extension information to Ugandan smallholder farmers.
 We examine the relative importance of (i) the way the information is delivered,
 (ii) the gender composition of the messenger(s), and (iii) the gender compositi
on of the viewer(s) in encouraging the uptake and adoption of modern input
 use and improved crop management practices.
 Specific emphasis is placed on exploring both the effectiveness and inclusivity
 of this ICT-enabled approach to extension information delivery for several
 reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we contribute to the literature on how ICTs can improve crop management
 practices among smallholder farmers—a topic that has received considerable
 attention in recent years but has lacked sufficient evidence on which approache
s work and for whom 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1111/agec.12314"

\end_inset

.
 The role of ICTs in improving access to information on crop management—as
 compared to improving access to market and price information—is a particularly
 challenging area.
 Information of this kind is often non-excludable and non-rival in nature,
 requiring government intervention when it is under-supplied by the private
 sector.
 Government intervention typically takes the form of information campaigns,
 extension programs, and advisory services which have been met with mixed
 success 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Feder2010,doi:10.1080/13892240903309595,doi:10.1596/1813-9450-2129,doi:10.1080/13892249985300061"

\end_inset

.
 These ambiguous outcomes are often associated with specificities of the
 technology, practice, or principle being promoted; the agroecological and
 socioeconomic context in which it is being promoted; and other confounding
 factors that may be poorly understood or too costly to address in program
 design and implementation..
 As a result, ICT applications to extension such as sms reminders, purpose-built
 smartphone apps, portable tablets and projectors, and other hardware and
 software solutions have received considerable attention in recent years
 as a means of addressing some—if not all—of these issues.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several studies have reported positive impacts of ICTs applied to extension
 services.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:hbs:wpaper:13-047"

\end_inset

 found that short message services (SMSs) pushed to farmers in Gujarat,
 India generated positive effects on crop choice and pesticide use decision
 and that the introduction of an interactive voice respose system signficantly
 increased cummin and cotton yields.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2016.1146700"

\end_inset

 found that a multi-media mobile phone-based product linked to expert advisory
 services increased farmers' awareness and knowledge about specific solutions
 to their production constraints in Madhya Pradesh, India.
 Maredia et al., on the other hand, found that while mobile phone-based animated
 videos shown to farmers in Burkina Faso induced learning and understanding,
 it was no more effective in encouraging adoption.
 Similarly, Grameen Foundation had some success using smartphones in Uganda
 to provide agriculture-related information to farmers through community
 knowledge workers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/1369118X.2016.1200644"

\end_inset

.
 Also in Uganda, showning short videos to potato farmers increases their
 knowledge on seed selection, storage and handling 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.1371/journal.pone.0169557"

\end_inset

.
 For recent reviews of this literature, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1146/annurev-resource-100913-012714"

\end_inset

.
 However, it remains to be seen how far these effects and be generalized,
 and questions about cost-effectiveness, scalability, and accountability
 often remain unaddressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, we address the persistent issue of gender bias in the provision
 of agricultural extension services and the dissemination of information
 to smallholder farmers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doss200127,FLETSCHNER20111422,peterman2011understanding,QUISUMBING2010581"

\end_inset

.
 Often, extension agents are male, and their default strategy for disseminating
 information on crop management is to target the main (or most accessible)
 decision-maker in a household, who is assumed to be male.
 The assumption that extension messages targeting one household member will
 spread to other household members—including women and youth who often play
 a substantial role in agriculture—may be false 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:fpr:ifprid:1411"

\end_inset

.
 Men do not necessarily discuss production decisions or share information
 to women household members, especially if extension messages focus on men's
 priorities and crops 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fletschner2011gender"

\end_inset

.
 Rather, evidence suggests that in certain contexts, gender homophily effects
 in whichmen learn more from other men and women learn more from other women,
 may dominate other intra-household information-sharing effects 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doss200127"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, we explore this issue further by investigating the extent to which
 farms are managed at the household level in a cooperative manner, e.g., through
 joint decision-making between and among male and female co-heads of household.
 This expands on recent advances in the measurement of gendered dimensions
 of empowerment, including decison-making power, intra-household distribution
 of decision-making power and control over income and resources 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ALKIRE201371,MAHMUD2012610"

\end_inset

.
 We further examine if women's involvement in and benefits from maize farming
 can be increased by questioning cultural norms and influencing aspirations
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:smu:ecowpa:1705,riley"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally and more broadly, we contribute to long-standing research efforts
 to document and measure the adoption and impact of improved agricultural
 technologies and practices among smallholder farmers.
 There are many reasons for the observed low rates of adoption of improved
 technologies and practices among smallholder farmers, including lack of
 access to credit and insurance, poorly developed labour markets, and asymmetrie
s of information 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1086/451461,jack2013market"

\end_inset

.
 Our contribution is methodological in nature in recognition of two important
 points.
 First, too few studies apply sufficiently rigorous methods to address concerns
 about sample selection bias and causal identification in the study of technical
 change in developing-country agriculture 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2010recent"

\end_inset

.
 Second, too few studies on ICT-enabled extension are replicated in differing
 contexts and populations to increase both generalizable findings and nuanced
 insights on the impact pathways through which ICT operates on farmers'
 decision-making about technology adoption.
 Our study adds to this growing body of literature and adapts a somewhat
 similar design under investigation in Ethiopia 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "tanguydiggreen"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experimental design (described in detail below) allows us to explore
 these research questions by comparing outcomes between groups of randomly
 assigned farmers that are given the opportunity to view versions of a video
 on improved maize management practices in different configurations.
 In addition to the video, a random group of farmers will also receive a
 phone number and instructions to call into the IVR system.
 A final ramdom subset of these farmers will also be targetted by 10 sms
 messages reminding them at specific times about important practices and
 the fact that they can always call the IRV.
 The experiment allows us to test the following three hypotheses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
H1: Improving the provision of information to smallholder farmers results
 in increases in awareness and knowledge about improved technologies and
 practices, increases in the adoption of these technologies and practices,
 improvements in on-farm productivity gains, and improvements in household
 welfare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many reasons for the observed low rates of adoption of improved
 technologies and practices among smallholder farmers.
 These include a lack of access to credit, missing risk markets, and poorly
 developed labour markets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1086/451461,jack2013market"

\end_inset

.
 We focus on the role of information inefficiencies and test low-cost interventi
ons designed to address various types of information gaps.
 Similar information interventions using ICT have been promising and include
 the Grameen Foundation's use of smart phones in Uganda to provide extension
 information through community knowledge workers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/1369118X.2016.1200644"

\end_inset

 and a mobile phone based technology that allowed farmers to call a hotline
 and ask questions to agricultural scientists and extension workers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:hbs:wpaper:13-047"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
H2: The effectiveness of information depends on who is targeted: jointly
 to male and female co-heads in a household or only the female co-head in
 the household as opposed to only to the male co-head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This hypothesis addresses the intra-household asymmetries of information
 that can lead to constrained decision-making on the adoption of new technologie
s and practices, and sub-optimal intra-household allocations of productive
 resources.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "kabunga2012heterogeneous"

\end_inset

 find that female farmers are less likely to adopt tissue-culture banana
 technology in Kenya, but would have an equal chance to adopt the technology
 were they able to acquire sufficient information about it.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1093/erae/jbv039"

\end_inset

 investigate the effect of gendered approaches to extension training among
 farmers in South Kivu, DR Congo, and find that joint male and female participat
ion leads to the highest adoption rates for several key technologies and
 practices.
 Mechanisms that explain these effects focus largely on changes in n relative
 bargaining power of the actors, gender-linked differences in access to
 complementary inputs, and overall intensity of exposure to information
 and training (see, e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Doss200127"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
H3: The effectiveness of information depends on who brings the information:
 jointly by male and female co-heads in a household or only the female co-head
 in the household as opposed to only the the male co-head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this hypothesis we will test is whether bringing the messages as a couple
 or as a female leads to better outcomes than when the information is given
 by a man as would be the default case.
 This hypothesis is based on the assumption that social norms prevent women
 from playing a more prominent role in household agriculture.
 Gender stereotyping, where women are expected to tend to small gardens
 used to produce for home consumption and men are responsible for cash crops
 using inputs obtained from the market, may contribute to inefficient allocation
 of resources within the household as a single unit of production.
 Research on how information campaigns can be used to change beliefs, norms
 and perceptions has been ongoing in public health and has only recently
 started to trickle through to other disciplines.
 Encouraging results emerge with respect to the importance of role models

\begin_layout Standard
The three hypotheses are tested with a field experiment.
 The experiment was implemented as a 3 by 3 factorial design to which a
 separate control group was added.
 In the first part of the study, where we look at the efficacy of different
 technologies to deliver information, we only concentrate on a single factor
 that has three levels, plus the control.
 The three levels are incremental and consist of (i) being shown a video
 (video); (ii) being shown a video and having received the IVR number and
 instructions on how to use it (video+IVR); and (iii) being shown a video
 and having received the IVR number and instructions on how to use it and
 being included in the SMS reminder campaign (video+IVR+SMS).
 This, together with the sample size in each treatment category, is illustrated
 in the top panel of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 For the second part of the study, we use two different factors that are
 placed orthogonal to each other, each with three levels.
 The first factor corresponds to the person(s) who provide the message and
 has three levels (male, female, and couple).
 Similarly, the second factor corresponds to the person who receives the
 information message, also with three levels (male, female, and couple).
 A separate control group receives no information.
 The design for the second part, together with the sample size in each cell,
 is illustrated in the bottom part of Figure

It should be stressed that these are not two separate experiments on two

 The layout pictured is a 2D representation of the design.
 The first factor is in fact placed orthogonal on the other two orthogonal
 factors, and as such, a more appropriate representation would be to draw
 the first factor as a third dimension to the second and third factor.

The design in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 allows us to test the three hypotheses outlined above.
 To compare the different modes of information provision (H1), we start
 by comparing the average outcome among farmers in the control group to
 the average outcome of farmers that were shown a video, irrespective of
 who the video was shown to and who provided the information in the video.
 This gives us the average treatment effect for the video intervention.
 To get the additional effect of the IVT treatment, we compare average outcomes
 of households that were shown a video (irrespective of who the video was
 shown to and who provided the information in the video) to households that
 were shown a video (irrespective of who the video was shown to and who
 provided the information in the video).
 Finally, the additional effect of the SMS campaign can be estimated by
 comparing outcomes of households that are shown a video and received the
 information about the IVR system to outcomes of household that were shown
 a video, received IVR information and also received the SMS reminders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test if information leads to more equitable outcomes when targeted to
 the female co-head or couple instead of the male co-head in the household
 (H2), we compare households where the female co-head received the information
 (irrespective of who provided the information) to households where the
 information was given to the male co-head (again, irrespective of who provided
 the information) and we compare households where the information was targeted
 to the couple (irrespective of who provided the information) to households
 where the information was given to the male co-head (again, irrespective
 of who provided the information).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test if information leads to different outcomes depending on who provides
 the information (H3), we compare outcomes of farmers where the information
 was provided by a female actor and outcomes of farmers where the information
 was provided by a farmer-couple (i.e., a male actor and a female actor performing
 together in the video) to outcomes of farmers where the information was
 provided by a single male or female farmer performing in the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sample size and its distribution over different treatment combinations
 was based on an elaborate series of power calculations.
 Instead of determining power analytically, we used simulation techniques.
 Simulation allows one to sample from actual data of outcome variables instead
 of relying on a theoretical distribution with an assumed mean and standard
 deviation, which is a much more intuitive way to think about statistical
 power.
 With this approach, it is straightforward to build in flexibility, such
 as allowing for more than one treatment arm, or account for sampling design
 effects such as clustered sampling.
 Power calculations were based on two outcome variables, one that reflects
 efficiency at the household level (maize yield) and one that reflects inclusive
ness (the gender productivity gap, where women-managed plots are farmed
 less extensively than male-managed plots resulting in significantly lower
 yields).
 The sample size was determined for each of the three hypotheses above.
 The power calculations and its underlying assumptions are described in
 great detail in the pre-analysis plan of this study.

Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conducted the field experiment among maize farmer in Uganda.
 Maize is widely consumed throughout much of Uganda, yet its value-to-weight
 ratio is sufficiently high to also make it an important traded commodity.
 Therefore, efforts to increase maize productivity at the farm-household
 level are an important dimension of Uganda's strategy to increase food
 security and reduce poverty through both consumption and income channels.
 Yet maize yields in Uganda are low when compared to neighbouring countries
 and global averages.
 While research station trials conducted in Uganda report potential yields
 of about 1.6 metric tons per acre (using only improved varieties without
 fertilizer application), data from the Uganda National Household Survey
 2005/06 indicate that average maize yields are much lower at about 618
 kg per acre for the main growing season of 2014.
 Moreover, there is considerable variation in productivity across farmers,
 with the top 10 percent of farmers achieving yields in excess of 1.1 metric
 tons per acre.
 At the same time, the use of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer
 and management practices such as row planting is very low in Uganda.
 For example, use of inorganic fertilizer average just 2.4 kg of nutrient
 per acre per year, compared to Kenya (75 kg/ac), Rwanda (70 kg/ac), and
 Tanzania (15 kg/ac).

\begin_layout Standard
Maize is especially important in eastern Uganda.
 We sampled from five districts in eastern Uganda known for their maize
 production: Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo, and Namutumba.
 From this, we removed town councils and also two sub-counties that consisted
 of islands in lake Victoria.
 Our study population consists of maize farmers within this region
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In particular, given the subject of our study, we target monogamous dual
 households that are growing maize.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We used two-stage cluster sampling to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, we first selected parishes randomly and in proportion to
 the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all the households, from which we then
 sampled households to be included in the study.
 At the same time, we suspect that outcomes within villages will be correlated,
 for instance due to local weather conditions, or development programs that
 are implemented in certain areas.
 We therefore used the village as a blocking factor.
 In other words, in each village, we made sure all possible treatment combinatio
ns related to the 2 factors (plus control) were administered.
 The experimental design described above shows that the messenger and the
 recipient factor combine into 9 different treatment combinations.
 Adding the control leads to 10 different households being selected in each
 village.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In eastern Uganda, there are two maize cropping seasons.
 For our study, we concentrated on the second maize-growing season, which
 runs from approximately August to January and is characterized by a shorter
 period of rains than the first maize-growing season.
 During this second season, the complete cycle from planting to harvest
 requires 3 to 3.5 months, and farmers tend to cultivate early-maturing but
 lower yielding maize varieties as a result.
 Fields are prepared in August, planted in September.
 The fields are weeded for the first time during the end of September or
 the beginning of October following germination, and again during late October
 as the maize starts to flower.
 Harvesting begins in mid to late December and, at higher elevations, can
 continue until mid January.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Intervention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main intervention used in the study were the videos that were screened
 with study participants using 10-inch Android tablet computers to individual
 farmers.
 Videos were screened by a trained field enumerator who sat with an individual
 farmer or a farmer-couple, depending on the household's random assignment
 to a treatment group.
 In accordance with the third factor in our factorial designs (varying the
 gender composition of the person(s) who provide the information) three
 videos were produced: one where the information was provided by a male
 farmer, one where the information was provided by a female farmer, and
 one where the information was provided by a couple (man+woman).
 Apart from varying this attribute of the treatment, the form and content
 of the three videos remained the same.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These videos were then shown to farmers according to the second factor in
 the factorial design (varying who receives the information: male, female,
 or couple).The control group received a placebo treatment, which was a music
 video of traditional dancing that contained no information related to farming
 .
 Videos were screened twice to each farmer in the sample, once before planing
 (July 2017) and once around planting time (August 2017).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information contained in the treatment groups' video is expected to
 positively influence maize yields by encouraging the adoption of several
 improved technologies and practices which, in turn, are expected to positively
 affect farm-household income.
 The topics included in the video script were obtained from qualitative
 interviews with key informants that were conducted in May 2017, and included
 maize farmers, value chain actors, maize breeders, extension workers, district
 agricultural officers, and other government staff and experts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main factors affecting maize productivity that were identified by these
 key informants were related to pests, poor soils, and poor seed quality.
 The three most important 
\series bold
pests
\series default
 that affect maize farming are striga (in particular the 
\emph on
Striga hermonihica
\emph default
 variety), maize stalk borer (
\emph on
Busseola fusca
\emph default
), and, more recently, fall armyworm (
\emph on
Spodoptera frugiperda
\emph default
).
 We focus on striga management in the videos because it was deemed more
 immediately problematic to our population of interest than maize stalk
 borer, and because,at the time this field experiment was conducted, there
 was no consistent strategy being promoted to address fall armyworm.
 Striga, also called whichweed, is a parasitic plant that feeds off the
 roots of maize, leading to severe stunting of the maize plant.
 Because the nutritional needs of maize are greatest at the early stages
 of growth, weeding of striga becomes less effective in curbing losses as
 the season progresses.Striga can reduce production from about 30 percent
 up to total loss of the crop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No single method is effective in controlling striga.
 Progress has been made in developing varieties resistant to the herbicide
 imazapyr and supplied with a imazapyr seed coating to contain striga before
 it can damage the host plant.
 However, the variety on offer in Uganda is expensive at 10,000 Ugandan
 Shillings (UGX) per kg
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At the time this study was conducted, the official exchange rate was approximate
ly UGX/USD 3,600.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and does poorly under dry conditions and in areas where the rains are short
 such as in eastern Uganda.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the near future, it is expected that the same herbicide-resistance trait
 and seed-coating technology will be released in early-maturing varieties
 such as Longe 10, which are preferred in eastern Uganda.
 See https://striga.aatf-africa.org/.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Crop rotation with sweet potato or beans can also reduce striga infestation,
 as can applications of phosphatic fertilizer to make up for the nutrients
 drained by the parasitic weed.Weeding is also a strategy to control striga,
 and is most effective in the weed's earliest growth stages, before it establish
es itself on the maize plant's root system and before it has a chance to
 spread via seed dispersal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Poor soils
\series default
, exhausted by continuous cultivation with little rotation, is the second
 main limiting factor.
 Soils often lack macro-nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P)
 and potassium (K), and farmers in our study area rarely use organic or
 inorganic fertilizers in sufficient quantities to ameliorate these deficiencies
, either at the planting stage (when diammonium phosphate (DAP) or NPK applicati
ons are recommended), or at the vegetative growth and tasseling stages (when
 top dressings of nitrogenous fertilizers such as urea are recommended).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout eastern Uganda, maize farmers mainly rely on 
\series bold
seed saved from harvest
\series default
, which represents the third limiting factor identifying by key informants.
 The reliance on saved (recycled) seeds tends to negate the significant
 yield advantages conferred by high-yielding maize hybrids, which require
 that new F1 seed be purchased at the start of each season to realize the
 gains conferred by heterosis or hybrid vigor.
 And even where farmers rely on recycled seed from improved open-pollinated
 varieties (OPVs) that do not require seasonal replacement, the gains from
 improvement tend to depreciate over three to four season, again requiring
 farmers to purchase new seed at regular intervals.
 Gains from the improved genetic qualities of both maize hybrids and OPVs
 can increase yields between 30 and 200 percent, depending on climatic condition
s and the complementary use of modern inputs and intensive management practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, there are also
\series bold
 crop management practices
\series default
 that affect yields, but the effects are generally smaller than those related
 to improved seeds and inorganic fertilizer use.
 The most important are timely planting, optimal plant spacing, and timely
 weeding.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Timely planting
\series default
 in eastern Uganda implies that maize should be planted at the onset of
 the rains.
 However, many farmers delay planting for several reasons.
 For instance, they may not be certain that the rains have really started.
 There may also be bottlenecks in land preparation, where the poor are often
 the last in line for the use of oxen or tractors.
 Experts estimate that for each day a farmer delays planting, yields are
 reduced by 1.5 percent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Optimal plant spacing
\series default
 implies that sowing should be structured so that plants are are not too
 close to each other such that they compete for light and nutrients which,
 in turn, reduces yields.
 Plants that are too far from each other means space is wasted, also leading
 to lower yields.
 Related is the number of seeds that farmer plant in each hill.
 Farmers want to be sure of germination and put more than one seed, sometimes
 up to 5.
 If they all germinate, there is competition for nutrients and sun, resulting
 in stunted growth.
 Usually there is also not enough thinning, or this is done too late when
 competition has already occurred.
 One expert told us that standard spacing is 75cm x 60cm with two plants
 per hill.
 However, several experts mentioned a new way of plant spacing of 75cm x
 30cm with 1 plant per hill which leads to a 35 percent increase in yields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Timely weeding
\series default
 implies that the first weeding should be done at 18-20 days after planting
 at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

three-leaf
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 stage, with the second weeding at 2-3 weeks after first weeding.
 From emergence to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eight-leaf
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 stage (when the maize is at about knee height), the maize plant is a very
 poor competitor and unwanted stress such as weed competition must be prevented.
 A third weeding at the tasseling stage is optional, and depends on observed
 weed pressure after the second weeding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the above, a significant portion of the videos focuses on providing
 technical information on seed choice, soil nutrient management (including
 the promotion of both organic and inorganic fertilizer application), weeding
 (with particular attention on fighting striga), timely planting, and plant
 spacing.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that the videos did not include explicit information on the use of
 chemical pesticides which can be effective in addressing pests but may
 also be hazardous to humans, animals, and the environment.
 The decision to exclude such information was made following a determination
 by the study team that currently available content on pesticide use was
 insufficiently attentive to issues of safe handling, application, storage,
 and disposal of pesticides that are warranted in any study involving human
 research subjects.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We made sure to include information that is likely to be unknown to the
 farmer, based on findings from other studies that information is most valuable
 when individuals learn about a new technology or institutional innovation

 However, other studies also provide evidence of behavioural change occurring
 through the compounding or re-emphasis of common knowledge that, through
 repetition, becomes more salient to the individual

 Therefore, the videos also contain information that farmers are assumed
 to know but do not seem to act upon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, not all constraints to maize productivity improvement are information
 asymmetries directly related to the use of inputs, technologies, and crop
 management practices.
 Often, missing information problems manifest indirectly, as uncertainty
 about the distribution of the farm-household's profit function.
 This includes uncertainty about the correlations between expected and actual
 returns, the inter-temporality of income streams, estimates of fixed and
 variable costs, hidden transactions costs, probabilities of adverse events,
 and a range of other variables that farmers may simply be unable to conceptuali
ze or measure

Farmers indeed often mention they do not use modern inputs because they
 have no money, suggesting liquidity is the main constraining factor, and
 thus instead of providing information, a more effective strategy would
 be to provide credit or subsidize inputs.
 Recent research, however, finds that despite what farmers claim, liquidity
 is often not the most important constraining factor.

 small quantities, putting it in reach of even the poorest households.

 attributed to the farmer's failure to commit.

 compare outcomes related to agricultural production between households
 that were given cash to households that were provided with insurance and
 find that when provided with insurance, farmers are able to find resources
 to increase expenditure on their farms.
 However, a recent study among rice farmers in Uganda does not find that
 providing objective information about the returns to different inputs and
 practices increased adoption

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, a significant portion of the videos also focuses on the costs and
 benefits of the different technologies and practices being promote.
 In addition, the videos encourage long-term thinking, advising farmers
 to (a) start small and grow their farm enterprise over time, and (b) combine
 technologies and practices together rather than investing all of their
 money and effort into one single input, practice, or technology.
 In short, we encourage them to experiment with combinations of technologies
 and practices on a small scale in the initial season before reinvesting
 their gains for larger-scale replication in subsequent seasons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also pay considerable attention to how the information is packaged.
 For instance, it is found that farmers find communicators who face agricultural
 conditions and constraints most comparable to their own to be the most
 persuasive than other communicators

\begin_layout Standard
The video starts with the farmer-actor or -actors introducing themselves
 (recall that three versions of this video were produced: one where the
 farmer-actor is male; one where the farmer-actor is female; and one where
 a pair of actors, one male and one female, act together).
 The farmer talks about how she used to struggle with her maize gardens
 and how at one point in time, she decided things needed to change.
 It is shown how the farmer sells a hen, obtains a small loan from a friend,
 and uses these proceeds to buy small quantities of improved seed and fertilizer
 from a local retailer.
 The video then shows how the farmer prepares the garden by collecting and
 applying manure.
 Next, the video details how maize seed are spaced at 75cm x 30cm intervals
 with 1 plant per hill, how the DAP is applied correctly, and what the correct
 timing of these activities should be.
 The video progresses to a field about 10 to 12 days after sowing when the
 maize has emerged from the soil, and she recommends that the farmer engage
 in gap filling to replace seeds that did not germinate , thereby preserving
 optimal plant density.
 The video proceeds to the field at 18 to 20 days after sowing, and she
 recommends how weeding should be conducted with particular attention to
 the identification of striga and the importance of follow-up weeding two
 to three weeks later.
 The video then advances to four weeks after planting, where she demonstrates
 how urea top dressing is done and recommends one more round of weeding
 at the tasseling stage.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The video then turns to a discussion about investing to get higher yields
 over time.
 She points out that while it may be difficult to raise cash, viewers can
 always start small (e.g., on one tenth of an acre) and reinvest the returns.
 She then explains that following recommended practices and using improved
 inputs led her to produce 2.5 bags of maize on a small plot, which she sold
 for UGX 125,000 with a profit of almost UGX 90,000—as compared to harvested
 one bag from the same area at a profit of only UGX 40,000.
 She then explains that she reinvested the difference (UGX 50,000)to increase
 the area under intensive maize cultivation year after year such that, over
 time, she was able to cultivate an entire acre using modern inputs.
 In the final part of the video, she reiterates her experience and again
 encourages the viewer to try a similar approach.

While we did not do a dedicated baseline survey, we did ask some questions
 before the first intervention to investigate balance.
 The choice of variables was based on what variables other researchers in
 similar studies use in their orthogonality tests.
 In particular, we looked at balance tables in studies that investigate
 the adoption of yield improving methods and technologies using RCTs.

 We collected some household characteristics such as household size, age
 and education level of household head.
 We then ask more specific questions related to maize farming, such as acreage
 and quantities produced in the last season.
 Furthermore, we ask if the household received agricultural extension, whether
 improved maize seeds were used, and whether fertilizer was applied.
 We also collect data on housing conditions (number of bedrooms) and distance
 to the nearest agro-input shop.

, we provide descriptive statistics, as well as balance tests for the three
 hypotheses related to the ICT technology used to deliver the information.
 Averages for the entire sample are reported in the first column.
 We see that few farmers that were included in our study had access to agricultu
ral extension in the previous year (about 11 percent).
 We also see that only about 20 percent of farmers reported to have used
 any fertilizer in the previous season and that about 38 percent reported
 to have used improved seed bought from a shop or agro-input dealer during
 the last cropping season.
 This suggests ample scope to increase intensification investments through
 extension.
 We also find that farmers produced on average only 286 kg of maize per
 acre in the first cropping season of 2017.
 This is substantially lower than the average yield of 618 kg per acre we
 find when using the Uganda National Household Survey of 2005/06.
 The low yields illustrate the devastating impact of the Fall Armyworm that
 ravaged maize yields in East Africa in 2017

Balance is demonstrated as differences between treatment groups for each
 characteristic as well as a joint significance test (F-test) for each of
 the three technologies.
 The second column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance"

\end_inset

, denoted video, compares baseline characteristics between households that
 were shown the placebo video and household that were shown an intervention
 video.
 For example, we see that yields prior to the intervention are about 21
 kg/ac higher in the group that was shown the video than in the group that
 was not shown the video.
 However, as can be inferred from the p-value, this difference is not significan
tly different from zero.
 In fact, for the control versus treatment comparison, none of the difference
 between baseline characteristics is significant at the 5 percent significance
 level, and also the F-statistic can not be rejected.
 In the third column, differences in baseline characteristics between households
 that received the video and households that received IVR on top of the
 video are shown.
 Here, we see that households in the latter group are significantly larger
 than households that only saw the video.
 They also have significantly more bedrooms.
 However, we can again not reject the null that jointly, baseline characteristic
s are unrelated to the treatment group for this comparison.
 For the final hypothesis related to the technology tested (comparing farmers
 that received video and IVR to those that additionally received sms messages;
 reported in column four and denoted +sms), we again find no significant
 differences in baseline characteristics, both for individual and joint
 comparisons.
 Overall, we conclude there may be some concern about balance when comparing
 the video only group to the video+IVR group, something we will further
 investigate when we look at the robustness of some of the results.

We did not repeat averages here to conserve space and because, even though
 they are based on a slightly smaller sample size as we drop the control
 group, they are very similar to those reported in Table

\end_inset

.
 In the first two columns, the comparison group for the baseline characteristics
 is the subgroup of the sample where the video was shown to only the male
 co-head.
 In the first column, we see that among the subgroup where the female co-head
 was shown the video, the household head was significantly younger than
 in households where the video was shown to the male co-head.
 While the age of the head is about 42 in the sample where the video was
 shown to the man, it is only about 34 in the group where the woman was
 given the video treatment.
 We also find that household heads are significantly lower educated in the
 sample where the recipient is the female co-head: while over 42 percent
 of head had finished primary education at baseline in the group where the
 male co-head was assigned to receive the video treatment, this in only
 26 percent among household where the was assigned to view the video.
 We also find less use of fertilizer and seed at baseline in the subgroup
 where women were shown the video then in households where men were shown
 the video.
 The fact that four out of nine comparisons turn out significant point to
 serious concerns about balance for the comparison between the group where
 men were shown the video within the household and the group where women
 were shown the video, something that is also reflected in the significant
 F-test.
 In the second column of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance_gender"

\end_inset

, we also find some indications of imbalance.
 In the subgroup where the video was shown to a couple, households are significa
ntly larger than in the subgroup where the video was shown to the male co-head
 only.
 We also find that in this subgroup, baseline fertilizer and improved seed
 use are lower than in households where the video was shown to the male
 co-head individually.
 Also here, orthogonality is rejected with a joint F-test.

\begin_layout Standard
In the last two columns of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the comparison group now consists of the households where the version
 of the video was shown where the man gives all the information.
 In column three, baseline averages of the comparison group are compared
 to baseline outcomes for households where the messenger was a woman.
 We do not find any systematic difference in baseline outcomes between these
 two groups, and the F-statistic is also insignificant.
 In column four, baseline averages of the comparison group are compared
 to baseline outcomes for households where the information was provided
 by a couple.
 Also here, we do not find any meaningful difference in baseline outcomes
 between these two groups.

Knowledge effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first tested the impact of the three different information interventions
 on knowledge.
 This was done through a short quiz 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "feder2004acquisition,feder2004sending,masset2015does"

\end_inset

 consisting of four questions that were asked during the endline survey
 to each of the two spouses separately.
 For each question, three possible answers were read out to the respondent,
 who was then asked to indicate what answer he or she though was correct.
 The respondent was also allowed to indicate he or she did not know what
 the correct answer was.
 The household was considered knowledgeable on a particular topic if at
 least one of the spouses indicated the correct answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first question was related to planting.
 In our video, we recommended a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with 1 plant per
 hill and this was the correct option among the alternatives.
 Other options were 75cm x 60cm with two plants per hill, which is standard
 for many farmers and recommended by many agricultural extension agents.
 We also added an intermediate alternative answer of 75cm x 30cm with 2
 seeds per hill.
 As we recommend a technique that deviates from what is assumed to be standard
 spacing, we assume that the recommended practice is new to most of the
 farmers.
 The second question is less related to technical knowledge, but more to
 viewing farming as a business.
 In the video, we pay ample attention to promoting an approach where farmers
 start small and grow over time through reinvesting and emphasize the benefits
 of combining inputs rather than investing only in e.g., improved seed.
 We wanted to see if farmers internalize this advice and ask what a successful
 farmer would do if he or she only has 40,000 shillings.
 The correct option was to use it to buy improved seed and fertilizer and
 start intensified farming on a small area.
 Alternative options were to: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

use all the money to buy hybrid seed, because without good seed, yields
 will be low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; and to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

use all the money to buy fertilizer, because with poor soils, yields will
 be low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For the third questions, we asked if they knew when weeding is most important.
 Weeding is most important during the first four weeks after planting, as
 maize is a poor competitor for light and nutrients.
 Alternative answers were: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when the maize is knee high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when the maize is at tasseling stage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is assumed that most farmers would know this.
 Finally, we also asked if farmers knew when spraying against the fall armyworm
 is most effective.
 There was no information given about fighting fall armyworm in the video,
 so unless seeing a video encourages farmers to search for additional informatio
n, we do not expect an impact from seeing a video.
 For this question, the correct option was: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

During the evening, as fall armyworm eats during night, while the other
 options were: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Early in the morning when it is still cool
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

At noon because sunlight increases chemical performance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Outcomes of the four knowledge questions are also combined into an index,
 constructed as the weighted mean of the individual standardized outcomes,
 using as weights the inverse of the co-variance matrix of the transformed
 outcomes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "anderson2008multiple"

\end_inset

.
 This, in addition to adjustments to the significance levels to account
 for Family Wise Error Rates (FWER), guards against over-rejection of the
 null hypothesis due to multiple inference.
 We use re-randomization to construct the joint null distribution for the
 family of outcomes we are testing.
 From this family-wise sharp null, we can obtain the corresponding FWER
 consistent significance thresholds by determining which cuttoffs yield
 eg.
 5%, 1% and 0.1% significant hypothesis tests across all tests and simulations.

 In the top panel, denoted as 
\emph on

 to the control group to the results of households that were shown a video,
 irrespective of who this video was shown to and who provided the information
 in the video
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For the comparison between different ways of delivering information to a
 household, we only keep households where the video was also shown to the
 man (as generally he will be the main decision maker).
 In other words, we removed households where the video was only shown the
 female co-head.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The first column reports the proportion of households in which at least
 one of the spouses was able to indicate the correct answer to the multiple
 choice question under consideration (and standard deviations are reported
 below between parenthesis).
 In the second column, we report difference (and standard errors of the
 differences between parenthesis) between the control group and the households
 that were shown a video.
 We find that in 15.5 percent of the households in the control group, at
 least one of the spouses could indicate the correct alternative among the
 response options to the question on optimal maize seed spacing.
 This relatively low rate of correct responses is due to the fact that this
 is a fairly new and potentially controversial recommendation.
 We see that among households that were shown a video, the proportion increases
 by 15 percentage points, to over 30 percent, and this difference is statistical
ly significant.
 About 91 percent of households that were not shown the treatment video
 know that is best to combine inputs instead of only using seed or fertilizer.
 Even though baseline knowledge is already high, the video treatment further
 increased this knowledge by another 5.1 percentage points.
 We further see that in about 95.4 percent of households in the control group
 at least one of the spouses was able to correctly indicate that weeding
 is most important during the first 4 weeks after planting and the intervention
 does not seem to have a significant effect on this outcome
\begin_inset Foot

In addition, our pre-analysis plan specified that we would drop from the
 analysis variables where 95 percent of outcomes are the same value to reduce
 the influence of outcomes with limited variation.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Finally, as expected, we do not find that households that were shown the
 video are more likely to know when one should spray against fall armyworm.
 Overall, and as confirmed by the knowledge index, we conclude that the
 agricultural extension videos increase knowledge at the household level.
 This seems to be especially the case for new information.

The second panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

+IVR
\emph default
, now compares knowledge of households that were shown the video to knowledge
 of households that were shown the video and in addition received the IVR
 treatment (the pure control group that received the placebo intervention
 is discarded from the analysis).
 We do not find any significant impact of augmenting the video intervention
 with an IVR service.
 However, since we now only focus on households that already learned from
 the video intervention, we find that knowledge in the comparison group
 is already high: for both knowledge the benefits of combining inputs and
 the timing of first weeding, about 95 percent of households in the comparison
 group know the correct answer and so results may suffer from limited variation
 in the outcome.
 The third panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 intervention to households that received the video, the IVR intervention
 and also received sms reminders to implement important practices and remind
 them of the existence of the IVR system.

now focuses only on households that received the video and, within that
 subgroup, differentiates between households where the video was shown to
 an individual (either the man or woman) and households where the video
 was shown to man and wife together (corresponding to hypothesis H2).
 We find that among households where the video was shown to an individual,
 28 percent knew the recommended spacing, 95.6 percent knew inputs are best
 combined, 94.3 percent knew weeding during the first 4 weeks is critical,
 and 30.8 percent knew when to spay against fall armyworm.
 We do not find a significant differences between the two groups.
 The fact that there is no difference in learning from the videos depending
 on who was targeted is confirmed by the index.
 The third panel, indicated as 
\emph on
H3: Individual versus couple pictured
\emph default
, compares household level quiz scores between households where the person
 that featured in the video was an individual (man or woman) and households
 where the information in the video was given by a couple (corresponding
 to hypothesis H3).
 Also here, we do not find significant differences in the proportions in
 the two groups.
 As such, at the household level, while showing a video increases knowledge,
 it does not seem to matter whether the couple is targeted or the video
 is shown to just one of the spouses.
 In addition, it does not seem to matter whether the information is provided
 by a couple or an individual.

 compares adoption rates for a range of technologies and practices between
 households in the control group that were shown the placebo video and household
s that were shown a video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first recommended practice we look at is early planting, which was emphasize
d in the video.
 We find that in about 36.6 percent of households where the placebo video
 was shown, at least one spouse reports they have started planting maize
 within one day following the first rains.
 This seems to be not significantly different from the proportion of households
 that reported planting immediately after the rains among households that
 were given information through the video.
 We also carefully explain a novel way of planting, where spacing between
 hills in a row is reduced but only one seed is planted per hill instead
 of the usual two.
 We see that the percentage of households in which at least one of the spouses
 reports this new way of planting on at least one plot is only 2.6 percent
 among the control group.
 However, this percentage increases to 10.5 percent and the increase is significa
ntly different from zero when households were shown the video.
 We find a similar positive impact from showing the video for the removal
 of striga according to the recommendations: in the control group, almost
 69 percent of households report removing striga before it flowers to reduce
 damage early on and prevent the weed from spreading.
 Among farm households that were shown the video, this percentage increases
 by 12 percent.
 However, the difference is not significant at the 5 percent level after
 correcting for multiple inference.
 We find that about 43 percent of control households report first weeding
 first after 18-20 days, which was what we recommended in the video.
 We do not find that this proportion is significantly higher among treated
 households.

We also collected detailed information on fertilizer use on maize plots.
 Overall, 44.7 percent of households in the control group reported they used
 fertilizer on at least one plot.
 While this percentage is almost 25 percent higher among treated farmers,
 the difference is not significant at the 5 percent level after controlling
 for FWER.
 We further collected information on the use of improved seed on the maize
 plots.
 Improved seed is already relatively high, with 55.3 percent of control household
s reporting to use either hybrid and/or open pollinated varieties on at
 least one maize plot.
 Seed adoption rates do not increase significantly after seeing the video.
 We also check if the proportion of households that combine improved seed
 with fertilizer increased after having been shown the video, as this is
 emphasized in the information treatment.
 While the percentage of households that report using both technologies
 increases by almost 25 percent, this difference is not statistically significan
t.
 The proportion of households that buy seeds on the market, as opposed to
 recycling used seed, also was not affected by the information treatment.

 While we do not promote the use of chemicals such as fungicides, pesticides
 or herbicides in our video, use rates may be indirectly affected.
 We find that about 44.7 percent of households used chemicals on at least
 one plot.
 We indeed see that this was about 14 percent higher in households that
 were shown the video.
 But also here, the difference is not statistically significant.
 Finally, we look if the video increased the likelihood that households
 hire in labour.
 While hiring in of labour seems common, the rate is not affected by the
 intervention.

 As for knowledge, the addition of an IVR service does not seem to further
 increase adoption.
 While we do find that the adoption of improved maize seed is almost 8 percent
 higher when IVR is added to the video campaign (and this effect is also
 somewhat reflected in an increase in the proportion of households that
 reports to buy seed from the market), the difference is not statistically
 significant.
 Similarly, we find little impact of an additional effect from augmenting
 video + IVR with the sms campaign (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Even though fertilizer use is almost 10 percent higher among farmers that
 were targeted by the sms campaign, the increase is not statistically significan

The table shows that among households were videos were shown to either the
 man or the woman separately, about 36.5 percent of households planted immediatel
y after the first rains and 8.9 percent followed recommended spacing on at
 least one plot.
 We also see that about 73.8 percent of these households where the recipient
 of the information was the individual removed striga before flowering and
 engaged in weeding in the third week.
 For none of these practices, a significant difference between the two treatment
 groups can be detected: it did not seem to matter whether this information

We did find that targeting matters for fertilizer use.
 We found that about 47.5 percent of households where the video was shown
 to only one individual reported using fertilizer on at least one plot.
 This percentage increased to 53 percent if the couple was targeted with
 the information.
 From further dis-aggregation of the fertilizer types (Table ), we learned
 that this difference was driven by organic fertilizer: Among households
 where the video was shown to only one of the spouses, about 22 percent
 reported to be using organic fertilizer on at least one plot.
 Among households where the video was shown to the couple, this percentage
 increased to 31.4 percent

 Furthermore, while we did not find a difference between the two groups
 in terms of the use of improved maize seed, we do see that households that
 received the information as a couple were more likely to combine fertilizer
 use with improved seed.
 We also see that the proportion of households that bought seed was higher
 among farmers where the video was shown the both spouses together, but
 the difference is not significant after adjusting for multiple hypothesis

 not be generalized as is also evident from the fact that the adoption index

 When estimating the impact of the video intervention, we see that among
 the control group, already a substantial proportion of farmers is using
 DAP or NPK (26 percent).
 This proportion is lower among households that were shown the video, but
 the difference is not significant.
 At the same time, the use of urea, as well as the use of organic fertilizer,
 seems to have increase in response to the information intervention.
 Urea use in particular, which was very low in the control group, more than
 doubled as a result of showing the video.
 Inorganic fertilizer use also increased substantially, from 16.2 percent
 to 24.2 percent.
 Most likely, this is due to the fact that, in the video, it is emphasized
 that inputs should be combined to get best results, and as a result some
 of the treated farmers reduce their use of DAP or NPK and increase adoption
 of Urea (and to a lesser extent inorganic fertilizer) to engage in more
 balanced soil nutrient management.

In the second panel of Table

 statistically significant after controlling for multiple comparisons).
 This may be because application of DAP or NPK is more complicated than
 Urea or organic fertilizer, and so a demand driven information service
 such as IVR may be more effective than showing a video.
 Finally, the third panel shows not additional effect of the sms intervention
 on the use of particular fertilizers.

Similar to fertilizer, we dis-aggregate by type of improved seed used for
 households where at least one spouse reported to be using improved seed
 on at least one maize plot.
 Results are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_seed-1"

\end_inset

.
 We find that showing the video did not influence the type of seed used
 among farmers that used improved seed.
 However, providing access to the IVR service increases the likelihood that
 hybrid seed is used from 30 percent to 35.7 percent.
 This is consistent with the interpretation that for more advanced technologies,
 a demand drive extension approach may be more effective.
 We do not find an additional impact from the sms campaign.

Impact on production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next turn to changes in production related outcome as a result of our
 experiment.
 We first look at household level maize production.
 During the endline survey, we asked both spouses separately to estimate
 how much maize was harvested from each plot.
 These quantities were then summed over the different plots for each spouse
 and the average between the two spouses was taken as the final estimate
 of household level maize production.
 We find that overall, a typical farm household in our sample produced about
 460 kg of maize.
 Households produced this on 1.13 acres on average.
 Taken together, we find that yields, defined as kilograms per acre, amounted
 to on average 470 kg per acre.
 This is much higher than yields recorded at baseline (290 kg/acre) as the
 rains were better and there was increased attention for strategies to combat
 fall armyworm.
 Still, compared to FAOSTAT figures (1000 kg/acre) or figures from household
 survey data (typically around 600 kg/acre), yields were below normal, as
 is also confirmed by the fact that in only 40 percent of households at
 least one spouse reported that yields were better than a typical year on
 at least one plot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:yield_ag_allh"

\end_inset

 reports results for the impact of the different technologies with respect
 to outcomes related to production.
 In the top panel we again compare outcomes of control households to outcomes
 of households that were shown the video.
 Household level production, expressed in logs and trimmed 5 percent at
 each end of the distribution, does not differ between the two groups.
 We do find, however, that households that were exposed to the agricultural
 extension video seemed to cultivate smaller plots: Reported acreage is
 11 percent smaller among households that were shown a video.
 However, the difference is not significant at the 5 percent level after
 controlling for FWER.
 The fact that the same amount is cultivated on a smaller area also resulted
 in the fact that in households that were shown a video, yields were 14
 percent higher than in control households.
 As mean productivity in control households was 428 kg/acre, this means
 mean productivity among households where the video was shown is about 488
 kg/acre.
 Further, in about 38.7 percent of households in the control group, at least
 one spouse indicates that yields were better than in a normal year on at
 least one plot.
 This is 2.7 percentage points higher among households that saw a video,
 but the difference is not significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, we find that the information intervention had a significant and
 positive effect on production outcomes, as is evident from the positive
 treatment effect in the production index.
 We can conclude that, at the household level, the videos thus seemed to
 positively affect the intensification of maize.
 Again, this can be traced back to the fact that in the video, it is emphasized
 that it is better to combine inputs and practices, and that as such, it
 is often better to start small.
 In addition, the video promotes a more commercial attitude towards farming,
 where investments are made at a small scale to be scaled up over time.

In the second panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we report additional production effects of adding IVR to the video interventio
n.
 Also here, we find a significant effect on productivity: the IVR intervention
 adds another 7.9 percent, increasing maize yields up to 526 kg/acre.
 However, in contrast to the effect from the video, the increase now seems
 to be driven by an increase in production while area planted reduces much
 less.
 This may be explained by the fact that the IVR system is more focused on
 technical information on how to implement certain practices or apply certain
 technologies, instead of the more holistic message we bring in the video.
 In particular, the video also pays attention to farming as a business and
 promotes a longer run perspective where farmers start small and grow over
 time.
 Finally, in the third panel, we report the impact of adding sms reminders
 to the video and IVR intervention on production outcomes.
 We do not find any additional effects.

Impact on household welfare
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at the impact of the information interventions on measures
 of well-being at the household level.
 Welfare is captured though self-assessment, as well as though consumption.
 We have asked these questions only to the woman within the household, as
 we assume she has a better idea of consumption expenditure within the household
 and the general level of well-being.
 First, we asked if they feel their household is better off (as opposed
 to equally well off or worse off) in terms of income and consumption than
 the average households in their community.
 We find that among the control group, about 40.1 percent of households felt
 they were better off than average (top panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact_welfare"

\end_inset

).
 This percentage was slightly higher among households that received the
 video intervention, but the difference was not statistically significant.
 Similarly, we asked the female in the household to indicate if they thought
 they were better off than six months ago.
 We find that among the households that did not get the agricultural extension
 video, 39.7 percent of households indicated they did better than half a
 year earlier, and this percentage was the same among the households that
 did get to see the video.
 Also here, the difference is not significant.
 We also include standard self assessed food security questions
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Where are these taken from
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We asked if households were generally able to eat their preferred food,
 and 42.6 percent of households responded affirmatively.
 We also asked if households were generally able to eat enough food and
 found this to be the case in almost 60 percent of baseline households.
 We found that, judged by these questions, the video intervention seemed
 to worsen food security, but the difference was not statistically significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a less subjective way to asses changes in well-being, we collected data
 on consumption.
 In particular, we asked the woman in the household about the value of the
 most consumed items, including auto-consumption.
 These included consumption of maize, cassava, sorghum, millet, rice, sweet
 potatoes, beans, fruits, groundnuts, vegetables, salt/sugar, cooking oil/ghee,
 soap, and airtime
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Even though these consumption categories were carefully chosen on the basis
 of consumption expenditure data from representative surveys in the area,
 we agree they may not capture everything and the estimates are likely to
 be too low.
 In addition, it may be that the intervention affected the composition of
 consumption, and farmers that had seen the video may have started consuming
 more of a food category that we did not measure, suggesting their consumption
 did not change.
 Care should thus be taken when interpreting this variable.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 From this we then took the logarithm and trim 5 percent at each end of
 the distribution.
 Results indicate that there was no difference in consumption between treated
 and control households.
 We ran similar comparisons for the IVR intervention and the sms intervention,
 but also failed to find any effect from these additional treatments.
 Results for this can be found in Table

We further test the hypothesis that households that were shown the video
 as a couple were better off at endline then households where only one of
 the spouses was shown the video.
 We find that about 42.9 percent of households in the group where only one
 of the spouses was exposed to the video felt they were better off than
 the average household in their community.
 This percentage increased to 47.2 percent if the video was shown to couples
 instead, but the difference was not significant after correcting for multiple
 comparisons

 We do not find any impact for the other measures of welfare.

 video featuring only one spouse, we find no significant difference on welfare

\begin_layout Subsection*
Changing gender attributes of the video intervention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this part of the paper we present results of changing 2 gender attributes
 of the video intervention.
 The first attribute relates to the gender of the targetted audience: while
 existing extension services generally target men within households, we
 investigate the consequences of targeting (additionally) the female co-head
 within the household.
 In particular, we report results for 2 comparisons: R1, which compares
 outcomes for households where the video was shown to a man to outcomes
 for households where the video was shown to the female within the households;
 and R2, which compares outcomes for households where the video was shown
 to a man to outcomes for households where the video was shown to both spouses
 together.
 The second attribute is related to the gender of the person that provides
 the information: existing extension services generally use male extension
 agents, and we investigate the consequences of changing this into a female
 messenger, or at least adding a female messenger to the male messenger.
 Also here, we report results for two comparisons: M1, which compares outcomes
 for households where the version of the video was shown where a man provides
 the information to outcomes for households where the version of the video
 was shown where a woman provides the information; and M2, which compares
 outcomes for households where the version of the video was shown where
 a man provides the information to outcomes for households where the version
 of the video was shown where a couple provides the information.
 We look at outcomes both at the household level as well as on the individual
 level and pay particular attention to the impact on intra-household decision
 making.
 We start by checking if changing gender attributes affect household level
 outcome and then look at individual outcomes

Household level consequences of changing gender attributes

Table

 shows the effect of changing who the information is given to on the likelihood
 that at least on of the spouses knows the correct answer to the respective
 question.
 The top panel compares
\series bold
 household level knowledge
\series default
.
 For example, we see that in couples where the video was shown to the male
 co-head only, the male or female co-head knew about optimal maize spacing
 in 29.5 percent of households.
 Interestingly, this likelihood is 5 percentage points lower in households
 where only the female co-head was shown a video.
 Even though we find no significant difference between the two groups of
 the other questions, the index does confirm that household level knowledge
 is lower in households where the video was shown to the woman than in household
s where the video was shown to the man.
 The second panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:R_hh_know"

\end_inset

 compares household level knowledge between the same control group (man
 is recipient) and households where a video was shown to male and female
 co-head together.
 We do not find any significant difference between these two groups.

 About half of the households in the comparison group report that they use

, we see that about 32.4 percent of households where the information was
 provided by a man reports that they are combining improved seed with fertilizer.
 This percentage seems to be slightly higher if the information was provided
 by a woman.
 However, after controlling for FWER, the difference becomes insignificant.
 We conclude that there is no impact on household level adoption from hanging
 the messenger attribute in video messages.

 Results pertaining to the factor related to who is targeted by the information

.
 The top panel presents responses to the multiple choice questions for the
 male co-head, the bottom panel for female co-head.
 We find that within households where the video was shown to the male co-head
 only, 26.2 percent of men know recommended maize spacing.
 As expected, if the video was only shown to the female co-head, significantly
 less men are able to answer correctly: the percentage of correct responses
 decreases by 14.3 percentage points.
 In other words, if men did not get the information, only about 12 percent
 of men knew the answer.
 This is virtually the same as the proportion of female co-heads that answered
 the question correctly without having seen the video (12.6) percent.
 Also according to expectations, showing the video to the female co-head
 increases her chance of answering correct.
 However, the effect is only half of the corresponding effect for men.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing the comparison group of male recipients to knowledge of the men
 in households where the video was shown to the couple, we find no significant
 difference.
 In other words, men do not learn more or less if the video was shown to
 the individual or to the couple.
 Similarly, the knowledge gain for the female co-head from watching the
 video by herself exactly matches the knowledge gain from watching the video
 together with the spouse.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find a similar pattern for awareness that modern inputs are best combined.
 When man see the video, they know the correct answer in about 90 percent
 of cases.
 However, if men were not treated, the proportion is only 81 percent.
 Women who did not see the video know that combining inputs is better in
 about 82 percent of cases.
 Showing them the video increases this significantly, but the increase is
 only about 5 percentage points, 3 percentage points lower than the correspondin
g effect for men.
 Also here, in terms of knowledge gained for the individual, it does not
 seem to matter whether the information was obtained individually or together
 with the spouse.
 We find no effects for weeding.
 As expected, there is also no impact on knowledge on how to fight fall
 armyworm at the individual level, as the videos did not contain information
 on this.

We ran a similar analysis for the factor related to who provides the information
 to see how the messenger affects knowledge at the individual level.
 We find that knowledge levels as judged by the four multiple choice questions
 are fairly similar between men and women, and that the messenger attribute
 does not seem to made a difference.
 To conserve space, we report full results in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 in the Appendix.

\begin_layout Standard
During the endline, we asked each spouse to describe what happens if they
 disagree about any maize related issue.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Agreement-about-maize"

\end_inset

 reports in the top panel that about 45.1 percent of men in households where
 the video was shown to only the man will generally tell their wife they
 do not 
\series bold
agree
\series default
 about any maize related issue.
 Showing the video to the wife only instead of to the man significantly
 reduces the likelihood that the man tells his wife if he disagrees.
 If the video was shown to the couple, the likelihood that the man tell
 the wife if he disagrees is the same as the likelihood when the video was
 shown to the man only.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next question is a follow-up question on the previous one and inquires
 about what happens when the man tells the wife that he disagreed about
 a maize related issue.
 As such, this question was not asked to the 281 men that stated in the
 previous question that they did never tell their spouse if they disagreed
 about maize related issues.
 We see that in the comparison group where men were shown the video, about
 70 percent indicate that they then discuss the issue and 
\series bold
come to a conclusion that is mutually acceptable
\series default
 (as opposed to situations in which the man either ignored the woman or
 the man simply did what the other woman commanded).
 We further see that in households where the video was shown to both spouses
 together, the likelihood that they come to a conclusion after the man tells
 the wife he does not agree increases by 4.4 percentage points.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The likelihood that the women will tell the husband that she disagrees is
 about 5 percentage points lower than the likelihood that the man tells
 the wife.
 The fact that the woman is empowered with information seems insufficient
 to change this.
 However, if the video was shown to the couple, the likelihood that the
 woman speaks up increases by more than 12 percent.
 The follow up question on what happens (and was not asked to 307 women
 who said they never tell the husband if they disagree) also indicates that
 the likelihood that they come to an agreement is higher if the video was
 shown to both spouses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the lower panel Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Agreement-about-maize"

\end_inset

, we compare households that have seen the video where information was given
 by a man alone 
\emph on
(mes = man)
\emph default
 to households where information was provided by a woman alone 
\emph on
(mes = woman)
\emph default
 and a couple 
\emph on
(mes = couple)
\emph default
.
 We see that in 46.1 percent of the households where the messenger was a
 man, the man will tell the wife if he disagreed about any maize related
 issue.
 This percentage was significantly lower among households where the messenger
 was a couple
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Why? Do we have an explanation for this??? Could this maybe be that after
 seeing a couple in the video, the husband thinks the wife is entitled to
 her own opinion or her own way of doing things?
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Changing the messenger attribute did not seem to have an effect on the
 likelihood that the woman told the husband that she does not agree.
 Both men and women state that after disagreement is expressed, an agreement
 is reached in about 72 percent of the households.
 Also here, we find no impact of the messenger attribute.

 For each of the practices and inputs applied at plot level, we asked both

 Options included that (i) the husband made the decision to use a particular

 Based on this, we constructed plot level indicators for these three categories

 We also asked who made the decision to adopt the particular spacing that

 After we asked what was done to fight striga on the plot, we also asked
 who made the decision on how to do this (

 Similarly, after asking when first weeding was done, we asked who took
 the decision to do first weeding at that particular time (

 For fertilizer use (

 used.
 For instance, if a household member told us that DAP/NPK, Urea or organic
 fertilizer was used on a particular plot, we asked who made the decision
 to use this particular fertilizer on the plot.
 For seed use, we also inquired about who took the decision to use that
 particular seed.
 As the decision to combine seed and fertilizer was based on the two previous
 answers, this variable was also only available for plots where both fertilizer
 and improved seeds were used.
 We did not ask who took the decision to hire in labour.
 We also construct an indicator for overall decision making based on decision
 making on the individual practices and inputs.

 The first column in Table

 shows that among households where the video was shown to the man only,
 on about 36.6 percent of the plots, the man also made the decision on when
 to start planting on that particular plot.
 Furthermore, we learn that on 45 percent of the plots among the subgroup
 where only the man received the video treatment, the man decided to use
 chemical without consulting his wife.
 Interestingly, we see that for almost all practices, the likelihood that
 the man decides alone decreases substantially if the video is shown to
 the woman alone or to the couple instead.
 Particularly for the decision to use fertilizer, the effect is large: while
 man decide on about 40 percent of plots on which fertilizer to use, this
 proportion reduces to about 22 percent in the subgroup of households where
 the video was shown to the woman and about 26 percent in the subgroup of
 households where the video was shown to both spouses together.

 shows corresponding results for women decision making.
 The reduction in male decision making about crop management as a result
 of more inclusive extension is mirrored in an increase in decision making
 by women within the household.
 However, even after the increase in decision making of women when they
 are shown a video, women are still less likely than men to decided about
 adoption of practices on an average plot.
 For instance, when the male co-head is shown the video individually, women
 report they make adoption decisions on only 6.2 percent of plots.
 This percentage increases to 18.8 percent if the video was shown to the
 female co-head alone.
 This is still significantly lower than the 40 percent of plots the men
 make decisions on if they get to see the video.

 We find that showing the video to the woman co-head alone does not change
 the likelihood that decisions are taken jointly by both co-heads relative
 to cases where the video was shown only to the male co-head.
 Showing the video to both spouses jointly does seem to increase the likelihood
 of joint decision making for some practices, but none is significant after
 correcting for multiple comparisons.
 We did not find any significant effect of changing the messenger in the

Impact on adoption by plot manager
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous section, we have investigated the impact of the video interventi
ons on who decides about agricultural technology adoption.
 Here, we go one step further and test if the actual decision that was made
 differs between the different treatment groups conditional on who makes
 the decision.
 In particular, here, we investigate if the impact of a particular video
 intervention in terms of technology adopted is different if (i) the husband
 is the primary decision maker, (ii) the wife is the primary decision maker
 and (iii) decisions are made by husband and wife jointly.
 Results are in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adopt_manager"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the top panel of the table, we compare treatment and control households
 (corresponding to H1).
 In the first three columns, we report results on plots where the husband
 indicated he made the particular decision alone.
 For instance, we find that in the control group on 19.8 percent of plots
 where the man indicates he made the decision on when to start planting,
 planting was started immediately after the first rain as recommended in
 the video.
 This percentage does not differ significantly from male managed plots in
 the group that did see the video.
 Similarly, we find that the spacing that is recommended in the video was
 used on only 2 percent of plots where men made the decision with respect
 to spacing among control households.
 We find that this percentage increases by 5.4 percentage points in the sub-sampl
e that did get to see a video.
 On 69.8 percent of the plots where men decide on how to manage striga, recommend
ations were followed in the control group.
 This proportion increased to 82.2 percent among households that were shown
 the video.
 There is no difference between treatment and control groups in terms of
 optimal timing of first weeding on plots where men make the decisions.
 Furthermore, among the sample of households that did not get the agricultural
 extension information video, fertilizer was used on 28.8 percent of male
 managed, and this percentage is similar on male managed plots in households
 that did get the information treatment.
 We also find no difference between treatment and control for in adoption
 on male managed plots of seed use, on the likelihood that seed and fertilizers
 are combined or on seed recycling.
 We do find that our videos appear to crowd in the use of chemicals on male
 managed plots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The generally positive treatment effects of the video on practices on male
 managed plots do not seem to extend to women managed plots (reported in
 columns 4-6).
 We find no significant differences for the use of recommended spacing or
 the use of the recommended way to fight striga on female managed plots,
 nor are households that have seen the video more likely to use chemicals
 on their female managed maize plots.
 One interesting difference relates to fertilizer.
 Here, we do see that showing a video substantially increases the likelihood
 that fertilizer is used on women managed plots.
 The effect is also present on plots that are managed by husband and wife
 together (columns 7-9).
 On plots that are jointly managed, the likelihood that optimal spacing
 is adopted also increases by 6.2 percentage points after being shown a video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adopt_manager"

\end_inset

, we compare plot level adoption outcomes between households in which the
 video was shown to one of the spouses and households where the video was
 shown to the couple, differentiating by who manages the plot (corresponding
 to H2).
 Since in this treatment we aim to reduce inequality between spouses, we
 would expect adoption rates on male and female managed plots to move in
 opposite directions.
 At the same time, we would expect an increase in the adoption of practices
 on plots that are jointly managed.
 There are indications that the former mechanism is at work for striga managemen
t.
 Among households where the video was shown to an individual spouse, on
 almost 80 percent of female managed plots striga was removed before flowering,
 while this was only the case on about 74 percent of male managed plots.
 After information asymmetries were removed by showing the video to both
 spouses, the proportion of male managed plots on which the recommended
 way to fight striga is followed increase by 8.3 percentage points.
 When the video was shown to an individual instead of a couple, male managed
 plots seem to get priority for weeding: on about 28 percent of male managed
 plots, first weeding was done according to recommendation provided in the
 video, while this is the case for only about 18 percent of female managed
 plots.
 However, in households where the video was shown to the couple, the percentage
 of women managed plots where proper weeding practices were followed increases
 by more than 10 percentage points.
 For fertilizer, we see a particularly strong effect of showing the video
 to couples on adoption on jointly managed plot, increasing an already high
 percentage by another 16.7 percent.

 status (corresponding to H3).
 We find no differences related to these treatments.

Impact on production by plot manager
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:disag_prod"

\end_inset

 we look at how production is affected by our video intervention, also separatel
y for male, female and jointly managed plots.
 Here, plot management is defined by the person who decided that maize should
 be cultivated on the particular plot.
 We find that the intervention increased production, reduced area planted
 and increased maize yields most convincingly on male managed plots.
 On female managed plots, the intervention only results in a smaller cultivation
 area.
 On plots that are jointly managed, results are closer to those on male
 managed plots, but only the yield increase is significant.
 Looking at these results together with findings in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adopt_manager"

\end_inset

, it may be that in the context of the fall armyworm crisis, the use of
 chemicals was key to convert increased fertilizer use into higher yields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing households where the video was shown to an individual with households
 where the video was shown to the couple, we only find a statistically significa
nt difference for production on male managed plots.
 We again did not find any difference between groups where the information
 was provided by an individual and groups where the information was provided
 by a couple on production outcomes disaggregated by plot manager.

\begin_layout Section*
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a world characterized by incomplete and asymmetric information, targeted
 efforts to fill knowledge gaps can make a big difference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "banerjee2011poor"

\end_inset

.
 However, not every information campaign is equally effective, and often,
 seemingly small attributes, such as the way a message is framed, how it
 is delivered, who is targeted by the message and who delivers the message,
 can result in significant differences in impact.
 Understanding and quantifying the importance of each of these design attributes
 through rigorous evaluation research should therefore be an essential part
 of any knowledge exchange model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In thus study, we evaluate the effectiveness of Information and Communication
 Technology (ICT) mediated short video messages to disseminate agricultural
 extension information, an intervention that can be brought to scale relatively
 easily and at significantly lower cost than alternative modes of agricultural
 extension information 
\change_deleted 973716962 1528300994
provisoin
\change_inserted 973716962 1528300994
provision
\change_unchanged
.
 In addition, and motivated by the observation that most agricultural advisory
 services are biased toward men, this study looked at two gender related
 attributes of a stylized ICT mediated agricultural extension information
 campaign.
 The first attribute consists of the gender composition of the person or
 persons that provide the information.
 The second attribute is the gender composition of the person or persons
 to which the information is targeted.
 This allows us to test three hypotheses related to (1) the overall effectivenes
s of the information intervention (2) the role of information asymmetries
 within the household; and (3) the effectiveness cooperative approach to
 farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The various hypotheses are tested using a field experiment where the messenger
 of the information and the recipient of the information is randomly altered
 according to a 3 by 2 factorial design.
 The study population were maize farmers in Eastern Uganda, from which we
 sampled about 3,600 farmers.
 These farmers were then shown a video according to the treatment group
 they were randomly assigned to.
 The videos showed how inputs and improved farming practices can be used
 to increase production.
 It also explains important concepts in inter-temporal decision making.
 The messages are also packaged in an attractive way, with role model farmers
 explaining how intensification of maize production improved their lives.
 The videos were shown twice, once just before the the planting season,
 and once during planting stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the information campaign increased knowledge about recommended
 agricultural practices and about how to invest in farming.
 Especially if the information is about a new technology and it can be assumed
 that previous knowledge is limited, we find substantial knowledge effects
 that can be attributed to the intervention.
 We do not find a difference in household level knowledge depending on whether
 the information was targeted to the couple or to an individual within the
 household.
 We also do not find that farmers learn more if the information is brought
 by a couple as opposed to by either a man or a woman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also find that the video messages lead to the adoption of many of the
 practices and technologies that were promoted in the video.
 Households that were exposed to the video are more likely to fight striga
 according to recommendations and to use a new way of spacing that was illustrat
ed in the video.
 Also, we find that farm households reduce use of DAP/NPK and increase use
 of urea and inorganic fertilizer.
 Most likely, this is due to the fact that, in the video, it is emphasized
 that inputs should be combined to get best results, and as a result some
 of the treated farmers reduce their use of DAP or NPK and increase adoption
 of Urea and inorganic fertilizer to engage in more balanced soil nutrient
 management.
 We also find that for some inputs and practices, adoption is more likely
 if information is delivered to husband and wife jointly, but care should
 be taken when trying to generalize this finding to other practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further down the potential impact pathway, we also find evidence that showing
 a video led to an increase in maize yields of almost 14 percent.
 Most of this is driven by a reduction in area cultivated, which is again
 consistent with the message in the video to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

start small
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We also find significant effects on disposal, with households that were
 exposed to the video more likely to consume maize and keep less maize as
 seed for the next season.
 In general, we did not find significant differences between households
 where the video was shown to an individual and households where the video
 was shown to the couple.
 Furthermore, despite the impact on production, we did not find any impact
 on welfare, either measured as consumption expenditure or self-assessed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do see interesting differences from targeting either the individual or
 the couple in the household if we start looking at decision making processes
 within the household.
 For instance, we find that showing a video to a couple increases the likelihood
 that spouses will try to find a mutually satisfying solution when there
 is disagreement compared to when a video is only shown to one of the spouses.
 Showing a video to a couple also significantly reduces the propensity that
 spouses makes adoption decision by him/herself as compared to cases where
 the video was shown to only one individual.
 It also increases the proportion of plots on which decisions are made jointly,
 at least for some practices and technologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at the impact of the interventions on adoption and production
 for male managed, women managed and jointly managed plots separately.
 We find that showing a video does not increase fertilizer use on male managed
 plots, but does so on female managed plots and plots that are managed by
 husband and wife together.
 Reducing information asymmetries within the household by targeting husband
 and wife jointly reduces differences in adoption rates between male and
 female managed plots for some practices and increases adoption on jointly
 managed plots for others.
 However, we only find effects on productivity on male managed plots and
 on jointly managed plots.
 It may be that, in the context of the fall armyworm crisis, the use of
 chemicals may have been key to convert increased fertilizer use into higher
 yields, and women appear to have less access to chemicals for use on the
 plots they manage.
 We find no evidence of a couple role model effect among Ugandan smallholder
 maize farmers.
