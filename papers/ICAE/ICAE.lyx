\begin_layout Title
The Role of Gender in ICT-mediated Agricultural Information Campaigns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In programs to disseminate information through agricultural extension and
 advisory services, seemingly small design attributes—the way the information
 is delivered, who delivers the information, or who is targeted by the message—c
an result in significant differences in effectiveness and inclusiveness
 of the intervention.
 Information and communications technology (ICT) can reduce the costs associated
 with adapting design attributes to particular problems and contexts.
 This study investigates the impact of a video-mediated extension approach
 and the importance of the gender composition of the person(s) who provide(s)
 the information and the gender composition of the person(s) who receive(s)
 the information.
 We conduct a field experiment among smallholder maize farmers in Uganda
 to determine whether and how reductions in information asymmetries among
 and within households lead to a range of productivity- and welfare-improving
 outcomes.
 Specifically, we assess the effectiveness of the approach by measuring
 knowledge gained, adoption of modern inputs and recommend practices, maize
 production and disposal, and well-being.
 We assess the approach’s inclusivity by exploring gender-disaggregated
 effects on in intra-household decision-making, cooperative approaches to
 household farming, and other equity indicators.
 We find that short extension video messages increase knowledge, technology
 adoption, and production at the household level, especially when the informatio
n is targeted to both husband and wife as a couple.
 We also find that targeting the information to husband and wife jointly
 leads to a significant increase in joint decision-making.
 Most of these household level effects, however, work through male-managed
 and jointly-managed plots, and women seem less able to use the new information
 on plots they manage directly and independently.
 Furthermore, we find no evidence of homophily or role model effects resulting
 from short videos featuring farmer-actors who are similar to the farmers
 participating in the experiment.

 In many instances, information campaigns, extension programs, or advisory

 to significant differences in an individual's decision-making

 In the context of smallholder agriculture, these inefficiencies have been
 well documented, especially where the lack of information about the existence,
 use, and profitability of modern inputs, improved technologies, and recommended
 management practices are a major constraint to sustainable crop intensification
, productivity growth, and food security

\begin_layout Standard
With new possibilities offered by information and communications technology
 (ICT), an abundance of pilot projects and commercial products have entered
 the market with a focus on revitalizing agricultural extension and advisory
 services in developing countries.
 However, a growing body of evidence suggests that not all ICT-mediated
 extension approaches are equally effective in achieving outcomes such as
 increased rates of technology adoption, higher crop yields, or improvements
 in household welfare and intra-household equity.
 Seemingly small design attributes—the way information is delivered, who
 delivers the information, and who was targeted—can significantly influence
 these outcomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper investigates the effectiveness of information about improved
 maize cultivation delivered to smallholder farmers in Uganda.
 In a first part, we consider the technology through which the information
 is delivered to the farmer, and differentiate between (i) short audiovisual
 messages viewed on tablet computers; (ii) Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
 systems that can be called upon if the need arises; and (iii) short message
 service (sms) nudges that remind farmers at particular points in time about
 key farming practices.
 The outcomes used to judge the relative effectiveness of the the difference
 technologies are generally aggregated to the household level and include
 knowledge gained, practices and and modern inputs adopted, farm production
 and disposal, and household well-being.
 In a second part, the paper further explores the role and importance of
 gender-related attributes in the design of the video-mediated approach
 that influence the inclusivity of extension information delivery.
 In particular, we focus on (i) the gender composition of the receiver(s)
 of extension messages and (ii) the gender composition of the messenger(s)
 of the information message.
 Experimental variations in these attributes allows us to test hypotheses
 related to information asymmetries within (dual) households.
 In addition, it allows us to test hypotheses related to the efficacy of
 videos containing illustrative and expositional content to change certain
 customs, beliefs or gender stereotypes related to maize farming

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A dual household is defined as a household containing both one male and
 one female member who take decisions as head of household either jointly
 or singly in their respective spheres of responsibility.
 It thus excludes single headed households or polygamous households.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The role of these gender related attributes is judged by looking at knowledge
 at the individual level, decision making within the households, as well
 as adoption and production outcomes conditional on who is the primary plot
 manager.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These hypotheses are tested using a field experiment in which farmers are
 randomly assigned to a group that receives a particular information interventio
n, and their outcomes are compared to the outcomes of a group of farmers
 that did not receive the information intervention 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2016field"

\end_inset

.
 As we want to test more than one research hypothesis and are particularly
 interested in comparing the relative effectiveness of various attributes
 of an ICT-mediated extension approach, we opt for a factorial design.
 Generally, in factorial designs, a smaller sample size is needed to answer
 a fixed number of research questions as opposed to parallel designs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We work with 3,600 participants sampled from the population of dual households
 cultivating maize across five districts of eastern Uganda.
 The core information interventions take the form of short videos that explain
 simple yet effective ways to increase maize productivity and profitability,
 such as best practices in row spacing, the importance of quality seed,
 optimal soil fertility management, and farm budget management.
 To test overall effectiveness of the information provided through the video,
 we compare outcomes of farmers that were exposed to a placebo video to
 outcomes of farmers that were shown the video.
 To about two third of the sample of farm households that were shown the
 agricultural information video, we also gave to toll free phone number
 and explained they could call this number any time if they needed more
 information on maize farming.
 Finally, to half of the sample of households that got the IVR number (and
 thus were also shown the video) we sent 10 sms messages at strategic points
 in time reminding them to about the importance of a particular technology
 or practice that was explained in the video and repeating that they can
 always call the IVR system if they want more information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test how information asymmetry within the household affects decision
 making and outcomes, we compare farm households where the video was shown
 only to the man in the household (the status quo) to households where the
 video was shown to the woman in the household, and to households where
 the video was shown to man and women together as a couple.
 To test the hypothesis on the importance of the gender (composition) of
 the person(s) providing the information, we produced different versions
 of the video.
 In each version of the video, the information was exactly the same, only
 the person (or persons) that featured in the video and explained everything
 was changed.
 In one version of the video, all the information is provided by an individual
 male farmer, while in a second version of the video, the information is
 given by a female farmer.
 In a third version of the video, the exact same information is given by
 a couple, each spouse taking turns in explaining things.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the farm household level, we find that providing information to farmers
 through short video messages increases their knowledge about modern inputs,
 improved technologies, and recommended practices.
 In addition, farmers who were shown the video are also more likely to adopt
 a range of inputs, technologies, and practices that were presented in the
 videos.
 We also find clear effects on production with maize yields 14 percent higher
 than in control households.
 However, these results do not translate into higher well-being.
 The IVR has no additional knowledge impact.
 The additional effect on technology adoption of IVR is also less significant:
 we only find a positive effect on the uptake of hybrid seed.
 Still, we do find that households that were allocated to the IVR treatment
 report yields that are 8 percent higher.
 The sms campaign has no additional impact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the household, we find greater nuance to these initial findings.
 First, the observed yield gains are observed on male- and jointly-managed
 plots: although we observe that providing information through the video
 messages increases women's involvement in decision making.
 However, the increase in participation in decision making does not translated
 into higher yields on women-managed plots.

In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of delivering agricultural
 extension information to Ugandan smallholder farmers in the form of short
 videos screened individually using tablet computers.
 We examine the relative importance of (i) the gender composition of the
 messenger(s), and (ii) the gender composition of the viewer(s) in encouraging
 the uptake and adoption of modern input use and improved crop management
 practices.
 Specific emphasis is placed on exploring both the effectiveness and inclusivity
 of this ICT-enabled approach to extension information delivery for several
 reasons.

 The role of ICTs in improving access to information on crop management—as

 These ambiguous outcomes are often associated with specificities of the
 technology, practice, or principle being promoted; the agroecological and
 socioeconomic context in which it is being promoted; and other confounding
 factors that may be poorly understood or too costly to address in program
 design and implementation.

Finally and more broadly, we contribute to long-standing research efforts
 to document and measure the adoption and impact of improved agricultural
 technologies and practices among smallholder farmers.
 There are many reasons for the observed low rates of adoption of improved
 technologies and practices among smallholder farmers, including lack of
 access to credit and insurance, poorly developed labour markets, and asymmetrie

 Our contribution is methodological in nature in recognition of two important
 points.
 First, too few studies apply sufficiently rigorous methods to address concerns
 about sample selection bias and causal identification in the study of technical

 Second, too few studies on ICT-enabled extension are replicated in differing
 contexts and populations to increase both generalizable findings and nuanced
 insights on the impact pathways through which ICT operates on farmers'
 decision-making about technology adoption.
 Our study adds to this growing body of literature and adapts a somewhat

Improving the provision of information to smallholder farmers results in
 increases in awareness and knowledge about improved technologies and practices,
 increases in the adoption of these technologies and practices, improvements
 in on-farm productivity gains, and improvements in household welfare.
 
\change_deleted 973716962 1528131658

In this hypothesis we will test is whether bringing the messages as a couple
 leads to better outcomes than when the information is given by an individual.
 This hypothesis is based on the assumption that social norms prevent women
 from playing a more prominent role in household agriculture.
 Gender stereotyping, where women are expected to tend to small gardens
 used to produce for home consumption and men are responsible for cash crops
 using inputs obtained from the market, may contribute to inefficient allocation
 of resources within the household as a single unit of production.

 Instead of determining power analytically, we used simulation techniques.
 Simulation allows one to sample from actual data of outcome variables instead

 In particular, we first 
\change_deleted 973716962 1528136429

selected parishes

)
\change_unchanged
.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all the households, from which we then
 sampled households to be included in the study.
 At the same time, we suspect that outcomes within villages will be correlated,
 for instance due to local weather conditions, or development programs that
 are implemented in certain areas.
 We therefore used the village as a blocking factor.
 In other words, in each village, we made sure all possible treatment combinatio
ns related to the 2 factors (plus control) were administered.
 The experimental design described above shows that the messenger and the
 recipient factor combine into 9 different treatment combinations.
 Adding the control leads to 10 different households being selected in each
 village.

 The reliance on saved (recycled) seeds tends to negate the significant
 yield advantages conferred by high-yielding maize hybrids, which require
 that new F1 seed be purchased at the start of each season to realize the
 gains conferred by heterosis or hybrid vigor.
 And even where farmers rely on recycled seed from improved open-pollinated

 However, as maize is cross pollinating, recycling of seed from the previous

 Hybrid seeds such as Longe 7, Longe 9 are available and have also been

 Hybird seeds potentially triple yields.
 In addition to hybrid seeds, which need to be procured every seasons as
 they can not be recycled, the government also released Open Pollinated
 Varieties (OPV).
 These are improved varieties that can be reused for about 3 or 4 seasons.
 In general, they are lower yielding than hybrid seeds.
 Still, yield are likely to be about 30 to 40 percent higher than when saved
 seeds are used, up to 100 percent if OPVs are also used in combination

 OPVs are generally recommended to poorer farmers as they can be reused

 Plants that are too far from each other means space is wasted, also leading

 Related is the number of seeds that farmer plant in each hill.
 Farmers want to be sure of germination and put more than one seed, sometimes
 up to 5.
 If they all germinate, there is competition for nutrients and sun, resulting
 in stunted growth.
 Usually there is also not enough thinning, or this is done too late when
 competition has already occurred.
 One expert told us that standard spacing is 75cm x 60cm with two plants
 per hill.

 30cm with 1 plant per hill which leads to a 35 percent increase in yields.

 While for some households, the combination of particular household specific
 market failures and heterogeneity in the production function may mean adoption
 is not profitable, we feel that in many cases the returns to the investment
 as perceived by the farmer may not correspond well to actual returns.
 Investments in agricultural inputs or technologies require the farmer to
 compare costs today to a stream of uncertain future incomes.
 However, farmers may not have precise information about fixed and variable
 costs involved, about the level and variability of the stream of future
 income, or about the time frame.

While we did not do a dedicated baseline survey, we did ask some questions
 before the first intervention to investigate balance.
 The choice of variables was based on what variables other researchers in
 similar studies use in their orthogonality tests.
 In particular, we looked at balance tables in studies that investigate
 the adoption of yield improving methods and technologies using RCTs.
 These studies include

 In particular, we collect some household characteristics such as household
 size, age and education level of household head.
 We then ask more specific questions related to maize farming, such as acreage
 and quantities produced in the last season.
 Furthermore, we ask if the household received agricultural extension, whether
 improved maize seeds were used, and whether fertilizer was applied.
 We also collect data on housing conditions (material of wall and number
 of bedrooms) and access to off-farm income.
 In Table

The table shows that few farmers that were included in our study had access
 to agricultural extension in the previous year.
 We also see that only about 20 percent of farmers reported to have used
 about 38 percent reported to have used improved seed bought from a shop
 or agro-input dealer during the last cropping season.
 This suggests ample scope to increase intensification investments through
 extension.
 We also find that farmers produced on average only 287 kg of maize per
 acre in the first cropping season of 2017.
 This is substantially lower than the average yield of 618 kg per acre we
 find when using the Uganda National Household Survey of 2005/06.
 The low yields illustrate the devastating impact of the Fall Armyworm that
 ravaged maize yields in East Africa in 2017

The table also shows some imbalance, particularly with respect to the asymmetric
 information hypothesis (H2), where farmers that were shown the video individual
ly are compared to farmers that received the information treatment as a
 couple.
 In particular, we find that households where the information was shown
 to a couple were significantly younger, and this difference is also reflected
 in some other variables.
 For instance, the fact that they are younger apparently also means they
 have fewer children, are more likely to have used fertilizer in the previous
 growing season.
 They also seem less likely to have finished primary education.

 For each question, three possible answers were read out to the respondent,
 who was then asked to indicate what answer he or she though was correct.
 The respondent was also allowed to indicate he or she did not know what
 the correct answer was.
 The household was considered knowledgeable on a particular topic if at
 least one of the spouses indicated the correct answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first question was related to planting.
 In our video, we recommended a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with 1 plant per
 hill and this was the correct option among the alternatives.
 Other options were 75cm x 60cm with two plants per hill, which is standard
 for many farmers and recommended by many agricultural extension agents.
 We also added an intermediate alternative answer of 75cm x 30cm with 2
 seeds per hill.
 As we recommend a technique that deviates from what is assumed to be standard
 spacing, we assume that the recommended practice is new to most of the
 farmers.
 The second question is less related to technical knowledge, but more to
 viewing farming as a business.
 In the video, we pay ample attention to promoting an approach where farmers
 start small and grow over time through reinvesting and emphasize the benefits
 of combining inputs rather than investing only in e

 We wanted to see if farmers internalize this advice and ask what a successful
 farmer would do if he or she only has 40,000 shillings.
 The correct option was to use it to buy improved seed and fertilizer and
 start intensified farming on a small area.
 Alternative options were to:

 For the third questions, we asked if they knew when weeding is most important.
 Weeding is most important during the first four weeks after planting, as
 maize is a poor competitor for light and nutrients.
 Alternative answers were: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

when the maize is knee high

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

.
 It is assumed that most farmers would know this.
 Finally, we also asked if farmers knew when spraying against the fall armyworm
 is most effective.
 There was no information given about fighting fall armyworm in the video,
 so unless seeing a video encourages farmers to search for additional informatio
n, we do not expect an impact from seeing a video.
 For this question, the correct option was:

 In the top panel, denoted as 
\emph on

\emph default
, we compare results on the quiz between households that were allocated
 to the control group to the results of households that were shown a video,
 irrespective of who this video was shown to and who provided the information
 in the video (corresponding to hypothesis H1).
 We find that in 16.4 percent of the households in the control group, at
 least one of the spouses could indicate the correct alternative among the
 response options to the question on optimal maize seed spacing.
 This relatively low rate of correct responses is due to the fact that this
 is a fairly new and potentially controversial recommendation.
 We see that among households that were shown a video, the proportion increases
 by 13.2 percentage points, to almost 30 percent, and this difference is
 statistically significant.
 About 91.2 percent of households that were not shown the treatment video
 know that is best to combine inputs instead of only using seed or fertilizer.
 Even though baseline knowledge is already high, the video treatment further
 increased this knowledge by another 5.1 percentage points.
 We further see that in about 94.6 percent of households in the control group
 at least one of the spouses was able to correctly indicate that weeding
 is most important during the first 4 weeks after planting and the intervention
 does not seem to have a significant effect on this outcome

.
 Finally, as expected, we do not find that households that were shown the
 video are more likely to know when one should spray against fall armyworm.
 Overall, and as confirmed by the knowledge index, we conclude that the
 agricultural extension videos increase knowledge at the household level.

, now focuses only on households that received the video and, within that
 subgroup, differentiates between households where the video was shown to
 an individual (either the man or woman) and households where the video
 was shown to man and wife together (corresponding to hypothesis H2).
 We find that among households where the video was shown to an individual,
 28 percent knew the recommended spacing, 95.6 percent knew inputs are best
 combined, 94.3 percent knew weeding during the first 4 weeks is critical,
 and 30.8 percent knew when to spay against fall armyworm.
 We do not find a significant differences between the two groups.
 The fact that there is no difference in learning from the videos depending
 on who was targeted is confirmed by the index.
 The third panel, indicated as 
\emph on

\emph default
, compares household level quiz scores between households where the person
 that featured in the video was an individual (man or woman) and households
 where the information in the video was given by a couple (corresponding
 to hypothesis H3).
 Also here, we do not find significant differences in the proportions in
 the two groups.
 As such, at the household level, while showing a video increases knowledge,
 it does not seem to matter whether the couple is targeted or the video
 is shown to just one of the spouses.
 In addition, it does not seem to matter whether the information is provided
 by a couple or an individual.

 compares adoption rates for a range of technologies and practices between
 households in the control group and households that were shown a video
 (corresponding to hypothesis H1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first recommended practice we look at is early planting, which was emphasize
d in the video.
 We find that in about 36.8 percent of households where the placebo video
 was shown, at least one spouse reports they have started planting maize
 within one day following the first rains.
 This seems to be not significantly different from the proportion of households
 that reported planting immediately after the rains among households that
 were given information through the video.
 We also carefully explain a novel way of planting, where spacing between
 hills in a row is reduced but only one seed is planted per hill instead
 of the usual two.
 We see that the percentage of households in which at least one of the spouses
 reports this new way of planting on at least one plot is only 3.2 percent
 among the control group.
 However, this percentage increases to 10 percent and the increase is significan
tly different from zero when households were shown the video.
 We find a similar positive impact from showing the video for the removal
 of striga according to the recommendations: in the control group, 70.4 percent
 of households report removing striga before it flowers to reduce damage
 early on and prevent the weed from spreading.
 Among farm households that were shown the video, this percentage is 5.8
 percentage points higher.
 We find that about 41 percent of control households report first weeding
 first after 18-20 days, which was what we recommended in the video.
 We do not find that this proportion is significantly higher among treated
 households.

We also collected detailed information on fertilizer use on maize plots.
 Overall, 47.9 percent of households in the control group reported they used
 fertilizer on at least one plot.
 While this percentage is almost 10 percent higher among treated farmers,
 the difference is not significant after correcting for multiple hypothesis
 testing
\begin_inset Note Note

.
 This can be explained by looking at the different types of fertilizer.
 We see that among the control group, already a substantial proportion of
 farmers is using DAP or NPK.
 This proportion is significantly lower among households that were shown
 the video.
 At the same time, the use of urea, as well as the use of organic fertilizer,
 seems to have increase in response to the information intervention.
 Urea use in particular, which was very low in the control group, almost
 doubled as a result of showing the video.
 Inorganic fertilizer use also increased substantially, from 19 percent
 to 26.5 percent.
 Most likely, this is due to the fact that, in the video, it is emphasized
 that inputs should be combined to get best results, and as a result some
 of the treated farmers reduce their use of DAP or NPK and increase adoption
 of Urea and inorganic fertilizer to engage in more balanced soil nutrient
 management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We further collected information on the use of improved seed on the maize
 plots.
 Improved seed is already relatively high, with 57.2 percent of households
 reporting to use either hybrid and/or open pollinated varieties on at least
 one maize plot.
 However, seed adoption rates remain constant after seeing the video.
 We also check if the proportion of households that combine improved seed
 with fertilizer increased after having been shown the video.
 While the percentage of households that report using both technologies
 increases by more than 10 percent, this difference is not statistically
 significant.
 The proportion of households that buy seeds on the market, as opposed to
 recycling used seed, also was not affected by the information treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also want to see if our intervention crowds in other technologies or
 practices.
 While we do not promote the use of chemicals such as fungicides, pesticides
 or herbicides in our video, use rates may be indirectly affected.
 We find that about 43.2 percent of households used chemicals on at least
 one plot.
 We indeed see that this was more than 11 percent higher in households that
 were shown the video.
 But also here, the difference is not statistically significant after adjusting
 for multiple hypothesis testing
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

.
 Finally, we look if the video increased the likelihood that households
 hire in labour.
 While hiring in of labour seems common, the rate is not affected by the
 intervention.
 Overall, as in the case of knowledge, the agricultural information intervention
 seemed to increase adoption of a range of modern agricultural technologies
 and recommended farming practices, and this conclusion is supported by
 a significant positive impact of the videos on the agricultural adoption
 index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results for the second main hypothesis, where households in which the video
 was shown to one of the spouses individually are contrasted with households
 where the video was shown to the couple, are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_recipient"

\end_inset

.
 The table shows that among households were videos were shown to either
 the man or the woman separately, about 36.5 percent of households planted
 immediately after the first rains and 8.9 percent followed recommended spacing
 on at least one plot.
 We also see that about 73.8 percent of these households where the recipient
 of the information was the individual removed striga before flowering and
 engaged in weeding in the third week.
 For none of these practices, a significant difference between the two treatment
 groups can be detected: it did not seem to matter whether this information
 was given to an individual or a couple.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We did find that targeting matters for fertilizer use.
 We found that about 47.5 percent of households where the video was shown
 to only one individual reported using fertilizer on at least one plot.
 This percentage increased to 53 percent if the couple was targeted with
 the information.
 From further dis-aggregation of the fertilizer types, we learned that this
 difference was driven by organic fertilizer: Among households where the
 video was shown to only one of the spouses, about 22 percent reported to
 be using organic fertilizer on at least one plot.
 Among households where the video was shown to the couple, this percentage
 increased to 31.4 percent

 Furthermore, while we did not find a difference between the two groups
 in terms of the use of improved maize seed, we do see that households that
 received the information as a couple were more likely to combine fertilizer
 use with improved seed.
 We also see that the proportion of households that bought seed was higher
 among farmers where the video was shown the both spouses together, but
 the difference is not significant after adjusting for multiple hypothesis

 As such, while the information provided thought the video seems more effective
 if targeted at the couple for some inputs and practices, this finding can
 not be generalized as is also evident from the fact that the adoption index
 does not significantly differ between the two groups.

 We can be brief about this: we did not find any difference between the

 Apparently, it does not matter if the information was given by an individual

Impact on production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next turn to changes in production related outcome as a result of our
 experiment.
 We first look at household level maize production.
 During the endline survey, we asked both spouses separately to estimate
 how much maize was harvested from each plot.
 These quantities were then summed over the different plots for each spouse
 and the average between the two spouses was taken as the final estimate
 of household level maize production.
 We find that overall, a typical farm household in our sample produced about
 460 kg
\change_deleted 973716962 1528300962
s
\change_unchanged
 of maize.
 Households produced this on 1.13 acres on average.
 Taken together, we find that yields, defined as kilograms per acre, amounted
 to on average 470 k

g
\change_deleted 973716962 1528300967

\change_unchanged
 per acre.
 This is much higher than yields recorded at baseline (290 kg/acre) as the
 rains were better and there was increased attention for strategies to combat
 fall armyworm.
 Still, compared to FAOSTAT figures (1000 kg/acre) or figures from household
 survey data (typically around 600 kg/acre), yields were below normal, as
 is also confirmed by the fact that in only 40 percent of households at
 least one spouse reported that yields were better than a typical year on
 at least one plot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 reports results for the three hypotheses with respect to outcomes related
 to production.
 In the top panel we again compare outcomes of control households to outcomes
 of households where at least one individual was shown a video (corresponding
 to hypothesis H1).
 Household level production, expressed in logs and trimmed 5 percent at
 each end of the distribution, does not differ between the two groups.
 We do find, however, that households that were exposed to the agricultural
 extension video seemed to cultivate smaller plots: Reported acreage is
 11 percent smaller among households that were shown a video.
 The fact that the same amount is cultivated on a smaller area also resulted
 in the fact that in households that were shown a video, yields were almost
 14 percent higher than in control households.
 Overall, we find that the information intervention had a significant and
 positive effect on production outcomes, as is evident from the positive
 treatment effect in the production index.
 We can conclude that, at the household level, the videos thus seemed to
 positively affect the intensification of maize.
 Again, this can be traced back to the fact that in the video, it is emphasized
 that it is better to combine inputs and practices, and that as such, it
 is often better to start small.
 In addition, the video promotes a more commercial attitude towards farming,
 where investments are made at a small scale to be scaled up over time.
 Comparing production outcomes between households where the video was shown
 to only one individual and households where the video was shown to the
 couple, we find no impact.
 Similarly, we do not find that it matters for production whether the informatio
n was given by an individual or by a couple.

Impact on household welfare

Finally, we look at the impact of the information interventions on measures
 of well-being at the household level.
 Welfare is captured though self-assessment, as well as though consumption.
 We have asked these questions only to the woman within the household, as
 we assume she has a better idea of consumption expenditure within the household
 and the general level of well-being.
 First, we asked if they feel their household is better off (as opposed
 to equally well off or worse off) in terms of income and consumption than
 the average households in their community.
 We find that among the control group, about 43 percent of households felt
 they were better off than average (top panel in Table

).
 This percentage was 47.1 among households that received the video intervention,
 but the difference was not statistically significant.
 Similarly, we asked the female in the household to indicate if they thought
 they were better off than six months ago.
 We find that among the households that did not get the agricultural extension

 We asked if households were generally able to eat their preferred food,
 but did not find any difference between treatment and control.
 We also asked if households were generally able to eat enough food.
 We find that in the group that was exposed to the video, less households
 reported that they had sufficient food, but the difference is not significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a less subjective way to asses changes in well-being, we collected data
 on consumption.
 In particular, we asked the woman in the household about the value of the
 most consumed items, including auto-consumption.
 These included consumption of maize, cassava, sorghum, millet, rice, sweet
 potatoes, beans, fruits, groundnuts, vegetables, salt/sugar, cooking oil/ghee,
 soap, and airtime

Even though these consumption categories were carefully chosen on the basis
 of consumption expenditure data from representative surveys in the area,
 we agree they may not capture everything and the estimates are likely to
 be too low.
 In addition, it may be that the intervention affected the composition of
 consumption, and farmers that had seen the video may have started consuming
 more of a food category that we did not measure, suggesting their consumption
 did not change.
 Care should thus be taken when interpreting this variable.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 From this we then took the logarithm and trim 5 percent at each end of
 the distribution.
 Results indicate that there was no difference in consumption between treated
 and control households.

We further test the hypothesis that households that were shown the video
 as a couple were better off at endline then households where only one of
 the spouses was shown the video.
 We find that about 42.9 percent of households in the group where only one
 of the spouses was exposed to the video felt they were better off than
 the average household in their community.
 This percentage increased to 47.2 percent if the video was shown to couples
 instead, but the difference was not significant after correcting for multiple
 comparisons

 We do not find any impact for the other measures of welfare.

 whichever measure we use.

Impact on decision making
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the objectives of this study is to investigate if small changes in
 the design of agricultural extension messages affect intra-household decision
 making.
 In particular, we want to make agricultural advisory services more inclusive
 and increase decision making by women in agricultural production

.
 In this section, we report differences in how spouses deal with disagreement
 related to maize production as a consequence of varying the recipient (H2)
 and the messenger (H3).
 We also report differences in who makes the decisions with respect to technolog
y adoption at the plot level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the endline, we asked each spouse to describe what happens if they
 disagree about any maize related issue.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Agreement-about-maize"

\end_inset

 reports that about 41 percent of men in households where the video was
 not shown to the couple together will generally tell their wife they do
 not agree about any maize related issue.
 Showing the video to a couple instead of to an individual increased this
 by about 3.7 percentage points, but the difference is not statistically
 significant.
 Among households where only one of the spouses was shown a video, the likelihoo
d that the women will tell the husband that she disagrees was slightly lower
 at 38.3 percent.
 However, if the video was shown to the couple, there was a significant
 increase in this percentage.
 Combining these two answers, we constructed an indicator that is true if
 both spouses indicate that they would generally tell the other if they
 do not agree about any maize related issue.
 We find that in households where recipients were individuals about 24.3
 percent of spouses told each other if they disagree.
 Among households where the video was shown to the couple, this percentage
 increased to 28 percent, but the difference is not significant at the 5
 percent significance level after adjusting for multiple comparisons

We next compare households that have seen the video where information was
 given by either a man or a woman to households where information was provided
 by a couple.
 We see that in half of the households where the messenger was an individual,
 the man will tell the wife if he disagreed about any maize related issue.
 This percentage was significantly lower among households where the messenger
 was a couple
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Why? Do we have an explanation for this??? Could this maybe be that after
 seeing a couple in the video, the husband thinks the wife is entitled to
 her own opinion or her own way of doing things?
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Changing the messenger attribute did not seem to have an effect on the
 likelihood that the woman told the husband that she does not agree.
 Among 49 percent of households where the version of the video was shown
 where an individual gave the information, both husband and wife indicated
 they will generally tell each other if they do not agree.
 This was 3.8 percentage points higher among households that were shown the
 version of the video where the information was given by a couple, but this
 difference is not significant at the 5 percent significance level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next question was a follow-up question on the previous one and inquires
 about what happens when one of the spouses told the other spouse that he
 or she disagreed about a maize related issue.
 As such, this question was not asked to individuals that stated in the
 previous question that they did never tell their spouse if they disagreed
 about maize related issues (281 men and 307 woman).
 As outcome, we computed the proportion of households in which the husband,
 the wife, or both responded that they talk and come to a conclusion that
 suits both, as opposed to situations in which the spouse either ignored
 the other or simply did what the other spouse commanded.
 Results are in the lower panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Agreement-about-maize"

\end_inset

.
 We found that in 72 percent of households that have been shown the video
 at the individual level, the man stated that if he disagrees with his wife,
 they will discuss the issue and come to a mutually satisfying solution.
 This percentage increased to 74.7 percent if the video was shown to a couple,
 but the increase is not significant.
 In 68 percent of households that have been shown the video at the individual
 level, the woman will discuss issues with the man if she did not agree
 and she said they will come to a mutually satisfying solution.
 This proportion increased by almost 7 percent, to 72.5, if the video was
 shown to both spouses together, and the adjusted p-value is just below
 the significance threshold
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
is 0.017 before adjustment
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The likelihood that both spouses indicated that if they disagree they talk
 and come to a common solution is almost 8 percent higher when the video
 was shown to a couple, but again, the difference is not significant.
 Overall, the index supports the conclusion that showing a video to a couple
 increases the likelihood that spouses will try to find a mutually satisfying
 solution when there is disagreement compared to when a video is only shown
 to one of the spouses.
 We did not find differences in spouses consulting each other conditional
 on who provided the information in the video.

\begin_layout Standard
We also looked at decision making on the adoption of different maize growing
 practices and the use of inputs.
 For each of the practices and inputs applied at plot level, we asked both
 spouses who decided to use the input or practice.
 Options included that (i) the husband made the decision to use a particular
 technology alone, (ii) that the wife took the decision to use a particular
 technology alone, or (iii) that both husband and wife jointly decided to
 use a particular technology.
 Based on this, we constructed plot level indicators for these three categories
 of decision making and compared differences between treatment groups.
 Results are summarized in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Dec_tech"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We looked at decision making on nine practices, corresponding to the adoption
 practices reported in Tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_h3_ag"

\end_inset

.
 In particular, we asked who made the decision to start planting at a particular
 point in time on each plot (
\emph on
time plant
\emph default
).
 We also asked how made the decision to adopt the particular spacing that
 was used on each maize plot (
\emph on
space
\emph default
).
 After we asked what was done to fight striga on the plot, we also asked
 who made the decision on how to do this (
\emph on
striga
\emph default
).
 Similarly, after asking when first weeding was done, we asked who took
 the decision to do first weeding at that particular time (
\emph on
time weed
\emph default
).
 For fertilizer use (
\emph on
use fert
\emph default
), seed use (
\emph on
seed
\emph default
), whether seed was bought (
\emph on
bought seed
\emph default
) and the use of chemicals (
\emph on
chem
\emph default
), we only asked who made the decision if the particular technology was
 used.
 For instance, if a household member told us that DAP/NPK, Urea or organic
 fertilizer was used on a particular plot, we asked who made the decision
 to use this particular fertilizer on the plot.
 For seed use, we also inquired about who took the decision to use that
 particular seed.
 As the decision to combine seed and fertilizer was based on the two previous
 answers, this variable was also only available for plots where both fertilizer
 and improved seeds were used.
 We did not ask who took the decision to hire in labour.
 We also construct an indicator for overall decision making based on decision
 making on the individual practices and inputs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Agreement-about-maize"

\end_inset

, we only compare households where the recipient was an individual to households
 where the recipient was the couple (corresponding to H2, first three columns
 in the table) and compare households where the messenger was an individual
 to households where the messenger was a couple (corresponding to H3, columns
 four to six in the table).
 For example, the first column in the top panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Dec_tech"

\end_inset

 shows that among households where the video was shown to a single spouse,
 on about 32 percent of the plots, the husband made the decision on what
 spacing to use (first column).
 This was about 3.5 percentage points lower in households where the video
 was shown to the couple (second column), and the difference is significant
 (RI based p-values are in the third column).
 Similarly, with respect to the timing of the first weeding, the likelihood
 that this was decided unilaterally by the man in the household reduced
 after the video was shown to the couple.
 If fertilizer was used on the plot, this was decided by the man on 26.7
 percent of the plots in the sample of households where the video was shown
 to only one of the spouses.
 Among households where the video was shown to the couple, the man only
 decided on fertilizer use on 21.7 percent of the maize plots.
 The likelihood that the husband alone decided to buy seed was also lower
 in households where the spouses were jointly screened the video.
 In general, and confirmed by the decision index, showing a video to a couple
 significantly reduces the propensity that the husbands makes adoption decision
 by himself as compared to cases where the video was shown to only one individua
l.
 For the comparisons in decision making between households where the messenger
 was an individual to households where the messenger was a couple, we can
 again be very brief: we did not find any significant difference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second panel below shows results for female decision making related
 to the technologies.
 Not surprisingly, women are generally less likely to make decisions themselves
 on plots, and thus the percentages were much lower.
 For instance, while on about 24.1 percent of the plots the husband reportedly
 made the decision on what to do against striga, the wife decided on how
 to fight striga on only 12.7 percent of the plots.
 Also here, we find that showing a video to a couple reduced the likelihood
 that the woman takes decisions alone as compared to households where the
 video was shown to an individual.
 For instance, while women solely took the decision on spacing on about
 17 percent of the plots in households where the video was shown to an individua
l, this reduced to 14.2 percent in households where both households were
 shown the video together.
 Women alone decided on less then 10 percent of plots which improved seed
 to use in households where the information was given to only one individual.
 This reduce to a mere 5.6 percent among households that received the treatment
 together.
 We also see significant reductions in the likelihood that a woman alone
 decided on combining seed and fertilizer and on decisions related to the
 purchase of seed when the household is exposed jointly to the agricultural
 information video.
 As in the previous case, we also do not find any significant effect of
 changing the messenger in the video on the likelihood that decisions are
 taken by the woman alone.

\begin_layout Standard
The third panel reports the proportions of plots where decisions related
 to particular technologies were taken by the husband and the wife jointly.
 We see that joint decision making was generally more likely when the video
 was shown to the couple, but the difference is significant for only two
 variables.
 First, while husband and wife jointly decided on how to fight striga on
 20.3 percent of plots in households where the video was shown to only one
 of the spouses separately, this percentage increased by 3 percentage points
 in the sample of households that were shown the video together.
 We also find that, among households that reported using fertilizers, the
 proportion of plots on which it was jointly decided which fertilizers to
 use was significantly higher among the subgroup that saw the video

\change_inserted 973716962 1528300989

.
 Second, while 17.5 percent of households in the group where the video was
 shown to only one individual report that they both decided to buy seed,
 this was 3.4 percentage points higher among the households where the video
 was shown to the couple.
 We did not find any significant effect of changing the messenger in the
 video on the likelihood that decisions are taken by the both spouses together.

\begin_layout Subsection*

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Impact on adoption by plot manager
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous section, we have investigated the impact of the video interventi
ons on who decides about agricultural technology adoption.
 Here, we go one step further and test if the actual decision that was made
 differs between the different treatment groups conditional on who makes
 the decision.
 In particular, here, we investigate if the impact of a particular video
 intervention in terms of technology adopted is different if (i) the husband
 is the primary decision maker, (ii) the wife is the primary decision maker
 and (iii) decisions are made by husband and wife jointly.
 Results are in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adopt_manager"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the top panel of the table, we compare treatment and control households
 (corresponding to H1).
 In the first three columns, we report results on plots where the husband
 indicated he made the particular decision alone.
 For instance, we find that in the control group on 19.8 percent of plots
 where the man indicates he made the decision on when to start planting,
 planting was started immediately after the first rain as recommended in
 the video.
 This percentage does not differ significantly from male managed plots in
 the group that did see the video.
 Similarly, we find that the spacing that is recommended in the video was
 used on only 2 percent of plots where men made the decision with respect
 to spacing among control households.
 We find that this percentage increases by 5.4 percentage points in the sub-sampl
e that did get to see a video.
 On 69.8 percent of the plots where men decide on how to manage striga, recommend
ations were followed in the control group.
 This proportion increased to 82.2 percent among households that were shown
 the video.
 There is no difference between treatment and control groups in terms of
 optimal timing of first weeding on plots where men make the decisions.
 Furthermore, among the sample of households that did not get the agricultural
 extension information video, fertilizer was used on 28.8 percent of male
 managed, and this percentage is similar on male managed plots in households
 that did get the information treatment.
 We also find no difference between treatment and control for in adoption
 on male managed plots of seed use, on the likelihood that seed and fertilizers
 are combined or on seed recycling.
 We do find that our videos appear to crowd in the use of chemicals on male
 managed plots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The generally positive treatment effects of the video on practices on male
 managed plots do not seem to extend to women managed plots (reported in
 columns 4-6).
 We find no significant differences for the use of recommended spacing or
 the use of the recommended way to fight striga on female managed plots,
 nor are households that have seen the video more likely to use chemicals
 on their female managed maize plots.
 One interesting difference relates to fertilizer.
 Here, we do see that showing a video substantially increases the likelihood
 that fertilizer is used on women managed plots.
 The effect is also present on plots that are managed by husband and wife
 together (columns 7-9).
 On plots that are jointly managed, the likelihood that optimal spacing
 is adopted also increases by 6.2 percentage points after being shown a video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adopt_manager"

\end_inset

, we compare plot level adoption outcomes between households in which the
 video was shown to one of the spouses and households where the video was
 shown to the couple, differentiating by who manages the plot (corresponding
 to H2).
 Since in this treatment we aim to reduce inequality between spouses, we
 would expect adoption rates on male and female managed plots to move in
 opposite directions.
 At the same time, we would expect an increase in the adoption of practices
 on plots that are jointly managed.
 There are indications that the former mechanism is at work for striga managemen
t.
 Among households where the video was shown to an individual spouse, on
 almost 80 percent of female managed plots striga was removed before flowering,
 while this was only the case on about 74 percent of male managed plots.
 After information asymmetries were removed by showing the video to both
 spouses, the proportion of male managed plots on which the recommended
 way to fight striga is followed increase by 8.3 percentage points.
 When the video was shown to an individual instead of a couple, male managed
 plots seem to get priority for weeding: on about 28 percent of male managed
 plots, first weeding was done according to recommendation provided in the
 video, while this is the case for only about 18 percent of female managed
 plots.
 However, in households where the video was shown to the couple, the percentage
 of women managed plots where proper weeding practices were followed increases
 by more than 10 percentage points.
 For fertilizer, we see a particularly strong effect of showing the video
 to couples on adoption on jointly managed plot, increasing an already high
 percentage by another 16.7 percent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 compares adoption outcomes between households that were shown the video
 where the information was provided by an individual farmer and households
 where the formation was given by a couple, separately for plot management
 status (corresponding to H3).
 We find no differences related to these treatments.

Impact on production by plot manager
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:disag_prod"

\end_inset

 we look at how production is affected by our video intervention, also separatel
y for male, female and jointly managed plots.
 Here, plot management is defined by the person who decided that maize should
 be cultivated on the particular plot.
 We find that the intervention increased production, reduced area planted
 and increased maize yields most convincingly on male managed plots.
 On female managed plots, the intervention only results in a smaller cultivation
 area.
 On plots that are jointly managed, results are closer to those on male
 managed plots, but only the yield increase is significant.
 Looking at these results together with findings in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adopt_manager"

\end_inset

, it may be that in the context of the fall armyworm crisis, the use of
 chemicals was key to convert increased fertilizer use into higher yields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing households where the video was shown to an individual with households
 where the video was shown to the couple, we only find a statistically significa
nt difference for production on male managed plots.
 We again did not find any difference between groups where the information
 was provided by an individual and groups where the information was provided
 by a couple on production outcomes disaggregated by plot manager.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a world characterized by incomplete and asymmetric information, targeted
 efforts to fill knowledge gaps can make a big difference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "banerjee2011poor"

\end_inset

.
 However, not every information campaign is equally effective, and often,
 seemingly small attributes, such as the way a message is framed, how it
 is delivered, who is targeted by the message and who delivers the message,
 can result in significant differences in impact.
 Understanding and quantifying the importance of each of these design attributes
 through rigorous evaluation research should therefore be an essential part
 of any knowledge exchange model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In thus study, we evaluate the effectiveness of Information and Communication
 Technology (ICT) mediated short video messages to disseminate agricultural
 extension information, an intervention that can be brought to scale relatively
 easily and at significantly lower cost than alternative modes of agricultural
 extension information

.
 In addition, and motivated by the observation that most agricultural advisory
 services are biased toward men, this study looked at two gender related
 attributes of a stylized ICT mediated agricultural extension information
 campaign.
 The first attribute consists of the gender composition of the person or
 persons that provide the information.
 The second attribute is the gender composition of the person or persons
 to which the information is targeted.
 This allows us to test three hypotheses related to (1) the overall effectivenes
s of the information intervention (2) the role of information asymmetries
 within the household; and (3) the effectiveness cooperative approach to
 farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The various hypotheses are tested using a field experiment where the messenger
 of the information and the recipient of the information is randomly altered
 according to a 3 by 2 factorial design.
 The study population were maize farmers in Eastern Uganda, from which we
 sampled about 3,600 farmers.
 These farmers were then shown a video according to the treatment group
 they were randomly assigned to.
 The videos showed how inputs and improved farming practices can be used
 to increase production.
 It also explains important concepts in inter-temporal decision making.
 The messages are also packaged in an attractive way, with role model farmers
 explaining how intensification of maize production improved their lives.
 The videos were shown twice, once just before the the planting season,
 and once during planting stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the information campaign increased knowledge about recommended
 agricultural practices and about how to invest in farming.
 Especially if the information is about a new technology and it can be assumed
 that previous knowledge is limited, we find substantial knowledge effects
 that can be attributed to the intervention.
 We do not find a difference in household level knowledge depending on whether
 the information was targeted to the couple or to an individual within the
 household.
 We also do not find that farmers learn more if the information is brought
 by a couple as opposed to by either a man or a woman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also find that the video messages lead to the adoption of many of the
 practices and technologies that were promoted in the video.
 Households that were exposed to the video are more likely to fight striga
 according to recommendations and to use a new way of spacing that was illustrat
ed in the video.
 Also, we find that farm households reduce use of DAP/NPK and increase use
 of urea and inorganic fertilizer.
 Most likely, this is due to the fact that, in the video, it is emphasized
 that inputs should be combined to get best results, and as a result some
 of the treated farmers reduce their use of DAP or NPK and increase adoption
 of Urea and inorganic fertilizer to engage in more balanced soil nutrient
 management.
 We also find that for some inputs and practices, adoption is more likely
 if information is delivered to husband and wife jointly, but care should
 be taken when trying to generalize this finding to other practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further down the potential impact pathway, we also find evidence that showing
 a video led to an increase in maize yields of almost 14 percent.
 Most of this is driven by a reduction in area cultivated, which is again
 consistent with the message in the video to

start small
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We also find significant effects on disposal, with households that were
 exposed to the video more likely to consume maize and keep less maize as
 seed for the next season.
 In general, we did not find significant differences between households
 where the video was shown to an individual and households where the video
 was shown to the couple.
 Furthermore, despite the impact on production, we did not find any impact
 on welfare, either measured as consumption expenditure or self-assessed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do see interesting differences from targeting either the individual or
 the couple in the household if we start looking at decision making processes
 within the household.
 For instance, we find that showing a video to a couple increases the likelihood
 that spouses will try to find a mutually satisfying solution when there
 is disagreement compared to when a video is only shown to one of the spouses.
 Showing a video to a couple also significantly reduces the propensity that
 spouses makes adoption decision by him/herself as compared to cases where
 the video was shown to only one individual.
 It also increases the proportion of plots on which decisions are made jointly,
 at least for some practices and technologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at the impact of the interventions on adoption and production
 for male managed, women managed and jointly managed plots separately.
 We find that showing a video does not increase fertilizer use on male managed
 plots, but does so on female managed plots and plots that are managed by
 husband and wife together.
 Reducing information asymmetries within the household by targeting husband
 and wife jointly reduces differences in adoption rates between male and
 female managed plots for some practices and increases adoption on jointly
 managed plots for others.
 However, we only find effects on productivity on male managed plots and
 on jointly managed plots.
 It may be that, in the context of the fall armyworm crisis, the use of
 chemicals may have been key to convert increased fertilizer use into higher
 yields, and women appear to have less access to chemicals for use on the
 plots they manage.
 We find no evidence of a couple role model effect among Ugandan smallholder
 maize farmers.
