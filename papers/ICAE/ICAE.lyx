\begin_layout Title
The Role of Gender in ICT-mediated Agricultural Information Campaigns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In agricultural information dissemination campaigns through agricultural
 advisory services, seemingly small design attributes, such as the way the
 information is delivered, who delivers the information, or who is targeted
 by the message, can result in significant differences in effectiveness
 and inclusiveness of the intervention.
 In the context of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) mediated
 knowledge transfer, this study investigates the importance of the gender
 composition of the person(s) who provide(s) the information and the gender
 composition of the person(s) who receive(s) the information.
 In particular, we set up a field experiment among smallholder maize farmers
 in Uganda to assess if reducing asymmetric information within the household
 leads to improved outcomes.
 In addition, we study the effectiveness of promoting a more cooperative
 approach to household farming.
 Effectiveness is assessed in terms of knowledge gained, adoption of modern
 inputs and recommend practices, maize production and disposal, and well-being.
 Outcomes are dis-aggregated by gender to study changes in intra-household
 decision making and equity.
 We find that short agricultural extension video messages increase knowledge,
 agricultural technology adoption, and production at the household level,
 especially when the information is targeted to both husband and wife as
 a couple.
 We also find that targeting the information towards husband and wife jointly
 leads to a significant increase in joint decision making.
 Most of these household level effects, however, work through male managed
 and jointly managed plots, and women seem less able to cash in on the new
 information on plots they manage.
 We find no evidence of role model effects emanating from short videos among
 smallholder farmers.

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often, the poor appear to make sub-optimal decision because they lack critical
 pieces of information, fail to notice 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "doi:10.1093/qje/qju015"

\end_inset

, or hold beliefs that are not true

key "doi:10.1162/qjec.2010.125.2.515,10.1257/app.3.1.1"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, in many instances, simple information campaigns designed to
 address these information inefficiencies can make a big difference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "banerjee2011poor"

\end_inset

.
 Also in the context of smallholder agriculture, it has been argued that
 a lack of information about the existence, use, and profitability of modern
 inputs and recommended practices is a major constraint to sustainable crop
 intensification 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jack2013market"

\end_inset

.
 This, together with new possibilities offered through innovations in Informatio
n and Communication Technologies (ICT) has led to several initiatives aimed
 at revitalizing agricultural advisory services in developing countries.
 However, it has also been found that not all information campaigns are
 equally effective and that seemingly small design attributes such as the
 way the information is delivered, who delivers the information and who
 was targeted can make a big difference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper investigates the effectiveness information delivered in the form
 of short audiovisual messages on tablet computers on agricultural outcomes.
 In addition, it investigates the importance of gender related attributes
 that are thought to be key in effective and inclusive agricultural extension
 information delivery.
 In particular, we zoom in the the role of (i) the gender composition of
 the receiver(s) of the agricultural extension information messages and
 (ii) the gender composition of the messenger(s) of the information message,
 allowing us to test two hypotheses.
 The first hypothesis is related to information asymmetries within the household
s, and we ask if it is more effective if both spouses within dual households
 receive the same information then if only one of them is given the information.
 The second hypothesis asserts that promoting a household cooperative approach
 to farming leads to better outcomes than when farming is framed as an idiosyncr
atic activity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The research hypotheses are tested using a field experiment, where farmers
 are randomly assigned to a group that receives a particular information
 intervention, and their outcomes are compared to the outcomes of a group
 of farmers that did not receive this particular information intervention
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2016field"

\end_inset

.
 As we want to test more than one research hypothesis and are particularly
 interested in comparing the relative effectiveness of various attributes
 of an ICT-mediated extension approach, we opt for a factorial design.
 Generally, in such a design, a smaller sample size is needed to answer
 a fixed number of research questions as opposed to parallel designs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We work with maize farmers in eastern Uganda.
 The information interventions take the form of short videos that explain
 simple yet effective ways to increase maize productivity, such as best
 practices in row spacing, the importance of quality seed, and optimal soil
 fertility management.
 To test overall effectiveness of the information provided through the video,
 we compare outcomes of farmers that were exposed to a placebo video to
 outcomes of farmers that were shown the video.
 To test the hypothesis on the importance of the gender composition of the
 person or persons targeted by the information, we compare outcomes of farm
 households where the video was shown to only one individual to outcomes
 of households where the video was shown to the man and women together as
 a couple.
 To test the hypothesis on the importance of the gender composition the
 person or persons providing the information, we produced different versions
 of the video.
 In one version of the video, all the information is provided by an individual
 farmer (either a man or a woman).
 Finally, in a second version of the video, the exact same information is
 given by a couple.
 Power calculations suggested we needed a sample of about 3,600 farmers,
 which was drawn from five districts.
 The videos were shown twice to farmers, once before the beginning of the
 main maize growing season, in July 2017, and again one month later during
 the onset of the rainy season when maize needs to be planted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the farm household level, we find that providing information to farmers
 trough short video messages increases knowledge.
 farmers that are shown a video are significantly more likely to select
 the correct answer from a set of alternative answers to a question.
 In addition, farmers who were shown the video are also more likely to adopt
 a range of improved technologies and follow recommended agronomic practices.
 We also find clear effects on production with maize yields almost 14 percent
 higher than in control households.
 However, the positive impact does not extend to household level welfare.
 We also find that showing the video to both spouses together has some additiona
l positive effects.
 For instance, it increases the women involvement in decision making.
 However, the increase in participation in decision making does not translated
 into better outcomes on women managed plots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
 The next section lays out the main research questions and corresponding
 hypotheses.
 In section 3, we explain the factorial design and corresponding sampling
 frame.
 The next two sections present the context and describes the video intervention
 used as treatment in the experiment.
 We then turn to the results, first presenting some baseline characteristics
 to investigate balance in the sample.
 We then compare outcomes at household level.
 In particular, we look at differences in knowledge, adoption of recommended
 practices and modern inputs, production and disposal and welfare.
 We also investigate if changes in the attributes of the video intervention
 affects decision making with respect to maize farming within households.
 We then turn to the individual level and investigate the impact of the
 intervention on adoption and production for male managed, female managed,
 and jointly managed plots separately.

\begin_layout Section*
Research Questions and Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to its public, nonrival nature, agricultural extension information is
 undersupplied by the private sector, so governments across the developing
 world have started providing extension information services on a large
 scale, albeit with mixed success.
 Although some studies have reported positive impacts of extension services,
 these effects are far from general, with cost-effectiveness, scalability,
 and accountability frequently cited as issues 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:eee:hagchp:5-44"

\end_inset

.
 Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has been advanced as a
 promising way to strengthen agricultural extension services 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Aker2011"

\end_inset

.
 The use of audiovisual messages delivered through mobile devices such as
 tablet computers or pico-projectors may be a cost effective way to reach
 more farmers in remote areas 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gandhi2009digital"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agricultural extension information services are also generally biased toward
 men.
 Most often, extension officers are male who target the main decision maker
 with respect to agriculture within households, which is also often assumed
 to be the male farmer.
 The assumption that extension messages targeting one household member will
 trickle down to the rest of the household, including women and younger
 household members who often play a substantial role in agriculture, may
 be false 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "magnan2015information"

\end_inset

.
 Men do not necessarily discuss production decisions or transfer extension
 knowledge to women household members, especially if extension messages
 focus on men’s priorities and crops 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fletschner2011gender"

\end_inset

.
 Gender homophily effects, where men learn more from other men and women
 learn more from other women, have also been reported in the context of
 agricultural extension services 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doss200127"

\end_inset

.
 At the same time, farms are essentially run and managed at the household
 level, and it may therefore be more effective if information is both provided
 and targeted at this level.
 The analysis of a Digital Green project in Ethiopia also concluded that
 there is much to be learned from observing the interactions between men
 and women who learn about the same technologies and practices

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of delivering agricultural
 extension information to smallholder farmers in the form of short videos
 shown at to farmers on tablet computers.
 In addition, we investigate the relative importance of (i) the gender compositi
on of the messenger(s), and (ii) the gender composition of the audience
 for effective and inclusive agricultural extension information delivery
 to encourage sustainable crop intensification in smallholder household
 farms and for improving gender equity in household farming.
 By comparing outcomes between groups of farmers that get to see different
 versions of the video in different configurations, we are able to test
 the following three hypotheses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
H1: A lack of knowledge is an important barrier to agricultural intensification
 and empowering farmers with information increases knowledge, adoption of
 best practices and modern technologies, increases productivity and enhances
 welfare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many reasons for the observed underadoption of intensification
 investments among smallholder farmers.
 These include a lack of access to credit, missing risk markets, poorly
 developed labour markets, etc.
 In this hypothesis, we focus on the role of information inefficiencies
 and test a cheap and soft intervention designed to address various types
 of information gaps.
 Similar information interventions using ICT have been promising and include
 the Grameen Foundation's use of smartphones in Uganda to provide extension
 information through community knowledge workers

 and a mobile phone based technology that allowed farmers to call a hotline
 and ask questions to agricultural scientists and extension workers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:hbs:wpaper:13-047"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
H2: Information is more effective if it is targeted to husband and wife
 jointly within the household, instead providing the information to only
 one individual within the household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This hypothesis is related to the existence of asymmetric information within
 the household, which may lead to a sub-optimal intra-household allocation
 of productive resources and intensification investments.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "kabunga2012heterogeneous"

\end_inset

 find that female farmers are less likely to adopt tissue banana culture
 technology in Kenya, but that they would have an equal chance to adopt
 innovations, provided that they acquire sufficient knowledge about the
 innovation.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "doi:10.1093/erae/jbv039"

\end_inset

 investigate the effect of participating in extension training as a couple.
 They investigate whether participation of female farmers in an agricultural
 extension programme in South-Kivu increases adoption of three technologies:
 improved legume varieties, row planting and mineral fertilizer.
 In their study, joint male and female programme participation leads to
 the highest adoption rates.
 Knowledge may also affect technology adoption and subsequent yields through
 changes in relative bargaining power of the actors.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Doss200127"

\end_inset

 find that adoption of agricultural technologies among female farmers is
 lower than among male farmers.
 They find that this is due to gender-linked differences in access to complement
ary inputs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
H3: Information is more effective if a cooperative approach to farming is
 promoted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this hypothesis we will test is whether bringing the messages as a couple
 leads to better outcomes than when the information is given by an individual.
 This hypothesis is based on the assumption that social norms prevent women
 from playing a more prominent role in household agriculture.
 Gender stereotyping, where women are expected to tend to small gardens
 used to produce for home consumption and men are responsible for cash crops
 using inputs obtained from the market, may contribute to inefficient allocation
 of resources within the household as a single unit of production.
 Research on how information campaigns can be used to change beliefs, norms
 and perceptions has been ongoing in pubic health and has only recently
 started to trickle through to other disciplines.
 Encouraging results emerge with respect to the importance of role models

\begin_layout Standard
The three hypotheses will be tested with a field experiment.
 The experiment was implemented as 3 by 2 factorial design to which a control
 group was added.
 We define two different factors, each with three levels.
 The first factor corresponds to the person(s) who provide the message and
 has three levels (male, female, and couple).
 Similarly, the second factor corresponds to the person who receives the
 information message.
 This factor also has three levels (male, female, and couple).
 A separate control group receives no information.
 The design, together with the sample size in each cell, is illustrated

The design in Figure

 allows us to test the three hypotheses outlined above.
 To test if the information campaign works, we simply compare the average
 outcome among farmers in the control group to the average outcome of farmers
 that received the information intervention, irrespective of who received
 the information and who provided the information.
 To test if information is more effective if it is targeted to the couple
 instead of the individual within the household (and hence test the asymmetric
 information hypotheses), we compare households where the couple received
 the information (irrespective of who provided the information) to households
 where the information was given to an individual (again irrespective of
 who provided the information).
 To test if projecting a household cooperative approach is more effective,
 we compare outcomes of farmers where the information was provided by a
 couple of farmers, irrespective of who within the household received the
 information, to outcomes of farmers where the information was provided
 by a single farmer, again irrespective of who received the information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sample size and its distribution over different treatment combinations
 was based on an elaborate series of power calculations.
 Instead of determining power analytically, we used simulation techniques.
 Simulation allows one to sample from actual data of outcome variables instead
 of relying on a theoretical distribution with an assumed mean and standard
 deviation, which is a much more intuitive way to think about statistical
 power.
 It is straightforward to build in flexibility, such as allowing for more
 than one treatment arm, or account for sampling design effects such as
 cluster sampling.
 Power calculations were based on two outcome variables, one that reflects
 efficiency at the household level (maize yield) and one that reflects inclusive
ness (the gender productivity gap, where women managed plots are farmed
 less extensively than male managed plots resulting in significantly lower
 yields), and sample size was determined for each of the three hypotheses
 above.
 The power calculations and its underlying assumptions are described in
 great detail in the pre-analysis plan of this study, which is available
 from the

Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We ran the experiment among maize farmer in Uganda.
 Maize is widely consumed, yet its value to weight ratio is sufficiently
 high to also make it an important traded commodity.
 Therefore, increasing maize productivity at the farm household level has
 the potential to lead to improvements in both nutritional outcomes and
 income.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maize yields in Uganda are relatively low.
 While on-station trials report potential yields of about 1.6 metric tons
 per acre (improved varieties, no fertilizer used), according to Uganda
 National Household Survey 2005/06 data, average maize yields are much lower,
 at about 618 kg per acre for the main growing season of 2014.
 There is a lot of variation in yields, with the top 10 percent of best
 farmers getting yields in excess of 1.1 metric tons per acre.
 At the same time, the use of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer
 and modern technologies such as row planting is very low in Uganda.
 For example, use of inorganic fertilizer is on average only 2.4 kg of nutrient
 per acre per year, compared to Kenya (75 kg/ac); Rwanda (70 kg/ac); and
 Tanzania (15 kg/ac).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maize is especially important in the East.
 We sampled from five districts eastern Uganda known for their maize production:
 Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo and Namutumba.
 From this, we removed town councils and also two sub-counties that consisted
 of islands in lake Victoria.
 Our study population consists of maize farmers within this region
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In particular, given the subject of our study, we target monogamous dual
 households that are growing maize.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We used two-stage cluster sampling to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, we first randomly selected parishes (proportional to the
 number of villages within each parish).
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all the households, from which we then
 sampled households to be included in the study.
 At the same time, we suspect that outcomes within villages will be correlated,
 for instance due to local weather conditions, or development programs that
 are implemented in certain areas.
 We therefore used the village as a blocking factor.
 In other words, in each village, we made sure all possible treatment combinatio
ns related to the 2 factors (plus control) were administered.
 The experimental design described above shows that the messenger and the
 recipient factor combine into 9 different treatment combinations.
 Adding the control leads to 10 different households being selected in each
 village.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the East, there are two maize cropping seasons.
 For our study, we concentrated on the second maize growing season, which
 runs from about August to January.
 In August, fields are prepared and planting is done in September.
 First weeding happens around the end of September or the beginning of October.
 By late October, a second round of weeding takes place as maize starts
 to flower.
 Mid to late December, harvesting starts.
 In higher areas, harvesting can go on until mid January.
 During the second season, farmers prefer early maturing varieties, as the
 rains are shorter.
 However, in general, early maturing varieties have lower yields.
 The full cycle from planting to harvesting in the study area takes about
 3 to 3.5 months.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Interventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information interventions are implemented as videos that were shown
 using 10 inch Android tablet computers to individual farmers (or to farmers
 as a couple according to the experimental design, see below).
 In accordance with the first factor in our factorial designs (to be able
 to vary the gender composition of the person(s) who provide the agricultural
 extension information) three videos were produced: one where the information
 was provided by a male farmer, one where the information was provided by
 a female farmer, and one where the information was provided by a couple
 (man+woman).
 Apart from varying this attribute of the treatment, the rest was exactly
 the same in the three videos.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These videos were then shown to farmers according the second factor in the
 factorial design (related to who receives the information).
 In particular, in part of the sample, a particular video was shown to only
 the man within the household.
 In other households, the video was shown to the woman within the household.
 In a final subgroup of the sample, a particular video was shown to the
 couple together.
 The control group received a placebo treatment.
 They got to see a music video with a traditional dance that has no information
 related to farming.
 Videos were shown twice to each farmer in the sample, once before planing
 (July 2017) and once around planting time (August 2017).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information is assumed to increase maize productivity through encouraging
 the adoption of modern technologies and recommended practices.
 The goal was thus to select those practices and technologies that are likely
 to have the largest impact on yield, household income and intra-household
 equity.
 The topics to be included in the video script were obtained from interviews
 with key stakeholder and experts, such as maize farmers, value chain actors,
 maize seed breeders, extension workers and other government staff such
 as the district agricultural officer.
 These interviews that were mostly qualitative in nature took place in May
 2017.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main factors affecting maize productivity were related to pests, poor
 soils, and poor seed quality.
 The three most important 
\series bold
pests
\series default
 that affect maize farming are Striga (in particular the 
\emph on
Striga hermonihica
\emph default
 variety), maize stalk borer (
\emph on
Busseola fusca
\emph default
), and now also Fall Armyworm (
\emph on
Spodoptera frugiperda
\emph default
).
 We choose to focus on striga, as maize stalk borer seemed less problematic
 and at the time of the research, there was no consistent strategy to address
 Fall Armyworm.
 Striga, also called whichweed, is a parasitic plant that feeds off the
 roots of maize.
 Doing so, it starts to draw nutrients from the host, leading to severe
 stunting of the host crop.
 As maize needs most nutrition at early stages of growth, weeding becomes
 less effective over time.
 In addition, each striga plant produces up to 50,000 seeds, which can remain
 dormant in the soil for a very long time.
 Striga can reduce production from about 30 percent up to total loss of
 the crop.
 No single method is effective to control striga.
 A new hybrid seed called Longe 7 HR, boosted with a herbicide, is said
 to be less affected by striga, but it is expensive at 10,000 Ugandan Shillings
 (UGX) per kg and does poorly under dry conditions and in areas where the
 rains are short such as in the East
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the East, early maturing varieties are preferred, such as Longe 10.
 In the future, a similar HR strain of Longe 10 is expected to be released.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Crop rotation with sweet potato or beans can reduce striga infestation.
 Furthermore, (additional) inorganic fertilizer use has also been recommended
 to counter striga.
 It has been observed that striga proliferates when soils are poor.
 In addition, one can make up for the nutrients drained by the parasite
 by boosting the maize with phosphorus-based fertilizer at planting stage.
 Weeding, especially the first time the striga comes up before it has had
 the chance to dig into the roots of the maize, is recommended, also to
 reduce the spread of seeds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Poor soils
\series default
, exhausted by continuous cultivation with little rotation, is the second
 main limiting factor.
 Soils lack macro-nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium
 (K).
 Farmers rarely use organic fertilizer.
 Experts say it is virtually impossible to get decent yields without using
 inorganic fertilizer.
 In particular, at planting stage, DAP (
\emph on
Diammonium phosphate
\emph default
) or NPK (a compound fertilizer providing N,P and K) should be used in the
 soil under the seed (basal application).
 After about 4 weeks, a nitrogen based fertilizer such as Urea should be
 applied on the topsoil near the plants to boost vegetation.
 Sometimes it is also advised to split the application of urea, administering
 half a doze at 4 weeks and half a dose at tasseling stage.
 Fertilizer can easily double yields.
 Especially used in combination with improved seeds, the effects of fertilizer
 are significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, farmers mainly rely on saved 
\series bold
seeds
\series default
, and maize in Eastern Uganda is no exception 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "McGuire2016"

\end_inset

.
 However, as maize is cross pollinating, recycling of seed from the previous
 harvest as seed in the next season leads to fast degeneration.
 Hybrid seeds such as Longe 7, Longe 9 are available and have also been
 distributed through Operation Wealth Creation.
 Hybird seeds potentially triple yields.
 In addition to hybrid seeds, which need to be procured every seasons as
 they can not be recycled, the government also released Open Pollinated
 Varieties (OPV).
 These are improved varieties that can be reused for about 3 or 4 seasons.
 In general, they are lower yielding than hybrid seeds.
 Still, yield are likely to be about 30 to 40 percent higher than when saved
 seeds are used, up to 100 percent if OPVs are also used in combination
 with fertilizer.
 OPVs are generally recommended to poorer farmers as they can be reused
 as seeds to some extent.
 Most hybrid seeds take long to mature.
 Farmers also complain that hybrids do not withstand drought very well.
 However, new varieties have entered the market that are both high yielding
 and early maturing.
 For example, UH5354, marketed as Bazooka, yields about 20 percent more
 than other hybrids and is drought resistant.
 Farmers that use these seeds report up to 40 bags of maize per acre

With average seeds farmers use, according to experts, yields are about 7-8

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, there are also 
\series bold
agricultural practices

 that affect yields, but the effects are generally smaller than those related
 to improved seeds and inorganic fertilizer use.
 The most important are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Timely planting
\series default
: maize should be planted at the onset of the rains.
 However, many farmers delay planting for several reasons.
 For instance, they may not be certain that the rains have really started.
 There may also be bottlenecks in land preparation, where the poor are often
 the last in line for the use of oxen or tractors.
 Experts estimate that for each day a farmer delays planting, yields are
 reduced by 1.5 percent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Optimal plant spacing
\series default
: Plant that are too close to each other compete for light and nutrients,
 reducing yields.
 Plants that are too far from each other means space is wasted, also leading
 to lower yields.
 Related is the number of seeds that farmer plant in each hill.
 Farmers want to be sure of germination and put more than one seed, sometimes
 up to 5.
 If they all germinate, there is competition for nutrients and sun, resulting
 in stunted growth.
 Usually there is also not enough thinning, or this is done too late when
 competition has already occurred.
 One expert told us that standard spacing is 75cm x 60cm with two plants
 per hill.
 However, several experts mentioned a new way of plant spacing of 75cm x
 30cm with 1 plant per hill which leads to a 35 percent increase in yields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Timely weeding
\series default
: The first weeding should be at 18-20 days after planting at the three
 leaf stage, and the second weeding at 2-3 weeks after first weeding.
 From emergence to 8 leave stage (knee height), the maize plant is a very
 poor competitor and unwanted stress such as weed competition must be prevented.
 A third weeding is optional.
 It is only dependent on weed pressure after the second weed.
 If needed, it should be done at tasseling stage.
 Experts estimates of returns to yield varied widely, and reached up to
 a 70 percent increase.

As mentioned above, pest control also ranks high among technologies that
 increase yields.
 However, we felt uncomfortable promoting chemicals in our videos that are
 potentially hazardous to humans, animals and the environment.

 used.
 Many of these are on the World Health Organization’s list of banned chemicals

Farmers indeed often mention they do not use modern inputs because they
 have no money, suggesting liquidity is the main constraining factor, and
 thus instead of providing information, a more effective strategy would
 be to provide credit or subsidize inputs.
 Recent research, however, finds that despite what farmers claim, liquidity
 is often not the most important constraining factor.

 While for some households, the combination of particular household specific
 market failures and heterogeneity in the production function may mean adoption
 is not profitable, we feel that in many cases the returns to the investment
 as perceived by the farmer may not correspond well to actual returns.
 Investments in agricultural inputs or technologies require the farmer to
 compare costs today to a stream of uncertain future incomes.
 However, farmers may not have precise information about fixed and variable
 costs involved, about the level and variability of the stream of future
 income, or about the time frame.
 Inter-temporal decision making requires a long run perspective, and concepts
 such as compounding may be poorly understood by subsistence farmers.

 In our videos, we pay considerable attention to pointing out the costs

 In addition, we encourage long term thinking where we advise farmers to
 start small and grow over time.
 We also point out that it is better to combine inputs and practices and
 urge them to use fertilizer and quality seed together instead of investing
 all the money and energy in eg.
 only seed.
 In short, we encourage them to experiment with combinations of recommended
 practices and modern inputs on a small area in the next season and reinvest
 in subsequent seasons.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The video starts with a farmer introducing himself.
 The farmer talks about how he used to struggle with his maize gardens and
 how at one point in time, he decided things needed to change.
 It is shown how the farmer sells a hen, and obtains a small loan from a
 friend.
 This money is than used to buy small quantities of improved seed and fertilizer
 in a local shop.
 It is then shown that, before planting the improved seed, the farmer prepares
 the garden.
 He is shown collecting manure and applying it.
 Next, it is shown in detail how the maize seed are spaced 75cm x 30cm with
 1 plant per hill and how the DAP should be applied.
 The viewer is reminded to plant in time.
 The next scene depicts the field after about 10 to 12 days when the maize
 has emerged from the ground.
 At this stage, it is recommended that the farmer engages into gap filling
 to replace seeds that did not germinate with new seeds to preserve optimal
 plant density.
 The next shot shows the field at 18 to 20 days after planing, when first
 weeding is done.
 Particular attention is paid to identification of striga at an early stage.
 It is also advised to weed again two to three weeks later.
 The next scene zooms in on Urea fertilizer application.
 Here, the field is shown at about 4 weeks after planting when the maize
 is knee high.
 It is shown how Urea topsoil dressing should be applied.
 Finally, it is recommended to do one more round of weeding around the tasseling
 stage of the maize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then spend some time on the concept of investing now to get higher yields
 over time.
 We point out that it may indeed be difficult to raise cash, but that the
 farmer can always start small (eg.
 on one tenth of an acre) and reinvest returns.
 It is explained that following recommended practices and using improved
 inputs led to 2.5 bags of maize on the small plot, which they sold for 125,000
 shillings, giving them a profit of almost 90,000 shillings.
 It is reminded that, if they had not used modern inputs or followed recommended
 practices, they would only have harvested one bag on that same area, and
 profit would be 40,000.
 It is further explained that they reinvested the difference between the
 profit they got and the profit they would have gotten without using inputs
 to increase the area under intensive maize cultivation year after year.
 Pretty soon, they are able to cultivate an entire acre using modern inputs.
 In the final part of the video, the farmer recapitulates and once more
 directly addresses the viewer to encourages him or her to try this as well.
 As mentioned above, three versions of this video were produced, one where
 the actor was a single male farmers as in the narrative above, one version
 where the farmer is a single woman and one version where a man and women
 act as if they are doing everything together.

While we did not do a dedicated baseline survey, we did ask some questions
 before the first intervention to investigate balance.
 The choice of variables was based on what variables other researchers in
 similar studies use in their orthogonality tests.
 In particular, we looked at balance tables in studies that investigate
 the adoption of yield improving methods and technologies using RCTs.

 In particular, we collect some household characteristics such as household
 size, age and education level of household head.
 We then ask more specific questions related to maize farming, such as acreage
 and quantities produced in the last season.
 Furthermore, we ask if the household received agricultural extension, whether
 improved maize seeds were used, and whether fertilizer was applied.
 We also collect data on housing conditions (material of wall and number
 of bedrooms) and access to off-farm income.

The table shows that few farmers that were included in our study had access
 to agricultural extension in the previous year.
 We also see that only about 20 percent of farmers reported to have used
 fertilizer in the previous maize growing season (April – July 2017) and
 about 38 percent reported to have used improved seed bought from a shop
 or agro-input dealer during the last cropping season.
 This suggests ample scope to increase intensification investments through
 extension.
 We also find that farmers produced on average only 287 kg of maize per
 acre in the first cropping season of 2017.
 This is substantially lower than the average yield of 618 kg per acre we
 find when using the Uganda National Household Survey of 2005/06.
 The low yields illustrate the devastating impact of the Fall Armyworm that
 ravaged maize yields in East Africa in 2017

The table also shows some imbalance, particularly with respect to the asymmetric
 information hypothesis (H2), where farmers that were shown the video individual
ly are compared to farmers that received the information treatment as a
 couple.
 In particular, we find that households where the information was shown
 to a couple were significantly younger, and this difference is also reflected
 in some other variables.
 For instance, the fact that they are younger apparently also means they
 have fewer children, are more likely to have used fertilizer in the previous
 growing season.
 They also seem less likely to have finished primary education.

Knowledge effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first tested the impact of the information intervention (H1) and the
 effect of changing the gender composition of the recipient (H2) and the
 messenger (H3) on knowledge.
 This was done through a short quiz consisting of four questions that were
 asked during the endline survey to each of the two spouses seperately.
 For each question, three possible answers were read out to the respondent,
 who was then asked to indicate what answer he or she though was correct.
 The respondent was also allowed to indicate he or she did not know what
 the correct answer was.
 The household was considered knowledgeable on a particular topic if at
 least one of the spouses indicated the correct answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first question was related to planting.
 In our video, we recommended a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with 1 plant per
 hill and this was the correct option among the alternatives.
 Other options were 75cm x 60cm with two plants per hill, which is standard
 for many farmers and recommended by many agricultural extension agents.
 We also added an intermediate alternative answer of 75cm x 30cm with 2
 seeds per hill.
 As we recommend a technique that deviates from what is assumed to be standard
 spacing, we assume that the recommended practice is new to most of the
 farmers.
 The second question is less related to technical knowledge, but more to
 viewing farming as a business.
 In the video, we pay ample attention to promoting an approach where farmers
 start small and grow over time through reinvesting and emphasize the benefits
 of combining inputs rather than investing only in eg.
 improved seed.
 We wanted to see if farmers internalize this advice and ask what a successful
 farmer would do if he or she only has 40,000 shillings.
 The correct option was to use it to buy improved seed and fertilizer and
 start intensified farming on a small area.
 Alternative options were to: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

use all the money to buy hybrid seed, because without good seed, yields
 will be low

; and to

 For the third questions, we asked if they knew when weeding is most important.
 Weeding is most important during the first four weeks after planting, as
 maize is a poor competitor for light and nutrients.
 Alternative answers were: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

when the maize is knee high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

when the maize is at tasseling stage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is assumed that most farmers would know this.
 Finally, we also asked if farmers knew when spraying against the fall armyworm
 is most effective.
 There was no information given about fighting fall armyworm in the video,
 so unless seeing a video encourages farmers to search for additional informatio
n, we do not expect an impact from seeing a video.
 For this question, the correct option was: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

During the evening, as fall armyworm eats during night, while the other
 options were:

 shows results for the three main hypotheses.
 In the top panel, denoted as 
\emph on
H1: Control versus Treatment
\emph default
, we compare results on the quiz between households that were allocated
 to the control group to the results of households that were shown a video,
 irrespective of who this video was shown to and who provided the information
 in the video (corresponding to hypothesis H1).
 We find that in 16.4 percent of the households in the control group, at
 least one of the spouses could indicate the correct alternative among the
 response options to the question on optimal maize seed spacing.
 This relatively low rate of correct responses is due to the fact that this
 is a fairly new and potentially controversial recommendation.
 We see that among households that were shown a video, the proportion increases
 by 13.2 percentage points, to almost 30 percent, and this difference is
 statistically significant.
 About 91.2 percent of households that were not shown the treatment video
 know that is best to combine inputs instead of only using seed or fertilizer.
 Even though baseline knowledge is already high, the video treatment further
 increased this knowledge by another 5.1 percentage points.
 We further see that in about 94.6 percent of households in the control group
 at least one of the spouses was able to correctly indicate that weeding
 is most important during the first 4 weeks after planting and the intervention
 does not seem to have a significant effect on this outcome

In addition, our pre-analysis plan specified that we would drop from the
 analysis variables where 95 percent of outcomes are the same value to reduce

.
 Finally, as expected, we do not find that households that were shown the
 video are more likely to know when one should spray against fall armyworm.
 Overall, and as confirmed by the knowledge index, we conclude that the
 agricultural extension videos increase knowledge at the household level.

The second panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:knowh0HH"

\end_inset

, labeled 
\emph on
H2: Individual versus couple targeted
\emph default
, now focuses only on households that received the video and, within that
 subgroup, differentiates between households where the video was shown to
 an individual (either the man or woman) and households where the video
 was shown to man and wife together (corresponding to hypothesis H2).
 We find that among households where the video was shown to an individual,
 28 percent knew the recommended spacing, 95.6 percent knew inputs are best
 combined, 94.3 percent knew weeding during the first 4 weeks is critical,
 and 30.8 percent knew when to spay against fall armyworm.
 We do not find a significant differences between the two groups.
 The fact that there is no difference in learning from the videos depending
 on who was targeted is confirmed by the index.
 The third panel, indicated as 
\emph on
H3: Individual versus couple pictured
\emph default
, compares household level quiz scores between households where the person
 that featured in the video was an individual (man or woman) and households
 where the information in the video was given by a couple (corresponding
 to hypothesis H3).
 Also here, we do not find significant differences in the proportions in
 the two groups.
 As such, at the household level, while showing a video increases knowledge,
 it does not seem to matter whether the couple is targeted or the video
 is shown to just one of the spouses.
 In addition, it does not seem to matter whether the information is provided
 by a couple or an individual.

 Table

 compares adoption rates for a range of technologies and practices between
 households in the control group and households that were shown a video
 (corresponding to hypothesis H1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first recommended practice we look at is early planting, which was emphasize
d in the video.
 We find that in about 36.8 percent of households where the placebo video
 was shown, at least one spouse reports they have started planting maize
 within one day following the first rains.
 This seems to be not significantly different from the proportion of households
 that reported planting immediately after the rains among households that
 were given information through the video.
 We also carefully explain a novel way of planting, where spacing between
 hills in a row is reduced but only one seed is planted per hill instead
 of the usual two.
 We see that the percentage of households in which at least one of the spouses
 reports this new way of planting on at least one plot is only 3.2 percent
 among the control group.
 However, this percentage increases to 10 percent and the increase is significan
tly different from zero when households were shown the video.
 We find a similar positive impact from showing the video for the removal
 of striga according to the recommendations: in the control group, 70.4 percent
 of households report removing striga before it flowers to reduce damage
 early on and prevent the weed from spreading.
 Among farm households that were shown the video, this percentage is 5.8
 percentage points higher.
 We find that about 41 percent of control households report first weeding
 first after 18-20 days, which was what we recommended in the video.
 We do not find that this proportion is significantly higher among treated
 households.

We also collected detailed information on fertilizer use on maize plots.
 Overall, 47.9 percent of households in the control group reported they used
 fertilizer on at least one plot.
 While this percentage is almost 10 percent higher among treated farmers,
 the difference is not significant after correcting for multiple hypothesis
 testing
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RI p-value is 0.038 before adjustment for multiple testing
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This can be explained by looking at the different types of fertilizer.
 We see that among the control group, already a substantial proportion of
 farmers is using DAP or NPK.
 This proportion is significantly lower among households that were shown
 the video.
 At the same time, the use of urea, as well as the use of organic fertilizer,
 seems to have increase in response to the information intervention.
 Urea use in particular, which was very low in the control group, almost
 doubled as a result of showing the video.
 Inorganic fertilizer use also increased substantially, from 19 percent
 to 26.5 percent.
 Most likely, this is due to the fact that, in the video, it is emphasized
 that inputs should be combined to get best results, and as a result some
 of the treated farmers reduce their use of DAP or NPK and increase adoption
 of Urea and inorganic fertilizer to engage in more balanced soil nutrient
 management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We further collected information on the use of improved seed on the maize
 plots.
 Improved seed is already relatively high, with 57.2 percent of households
 reporting to use either hybrid and/or open pollinated varieties on at least
 one maize plot.
 However, seed adoption rates remain constant after seeing the video.
 We also check if the proportion of households that combine improved seed
 with fertilizer increased after having been shown the video.
 While the percentage of households that report using both technologies
 increases by more than 10 percent, this difference is not statistically
 significant.
 The proportion of households that buy seeds on the market, as opposed to
 recycling used seed, also was not affected by the information treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also want to see if our intervention crowds in other technologies or
 practices.
 While we do not promote the use of chemicals such as fungicides, pesticides
 or herbicides in our video, use rates may be indirectly affected.
 We find that about 43.2 percent of households used chemicals on at least
 one plot.
 We indeed see that this was more than 11 percent higher in households that
 were shown the video.
 But also here, the difference is not statistically significant after adjusting
 for multiple hypothesis testing
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

.
 Finally, we look if the video increased the likelihood that households
 hire in labour.
 While hiring in of labour seems common, the rate is not affected by the
 intervention.
 Overall, as in the case of knowledge, the agricultural information intervention
 seemed to increase adoption of a range of modern agricultural technologies
 and recommended farming practices, and this conclusion is supported by
 a significant positive impact of the videos on the agricultural adoption
 index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results for the second main hypothesis, where households in which the video
 was shown to one of the spouses individually are contrasted with households
 where the video was shown to the couple, are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_recipient"

\end_inset

.
 The table shows that among households were videos were shown to either
 the man or the woman separately, about 36.5 percent of households planted
 immediately after the first rains and 8.9 percent followed recommended spacing
 on at least one plot.
 We also see that about 73.8 percent of these households where the recipient
 of the information was the individual removed striga before flowering and
 engaged in weeding in the third week.
 For none of these practices, a significant difference between the two treatment
 groups can be detected: it did not seem to matter whether this information
 was given to an individual or a couple.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We did find that targeting matters for fertilizer use.
 We found that about 47.5 percent of households where the video was shown
 to only one individual reported using fertilizer on at least one plot.
 This percentage increased to 53 percent if the couple was targeted with
 the information.
 From further dis-aggregation of the fertilizer types, we learned that this
 difference was driven by organic fertilizer: Among households where the
 video was shown to only one of the spouses, about 22 percent reported to
 be using organic fertilizer on at least one plot.
 Among households where the video was shown to the couple, this percentage
 increased to 31.4 percent
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Can we explain this? Why would this be the case?
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, while we did not find a difference between the two groups
 in terms of the use of improved maize seed, we do see that households that
 received the information as a couple were more likely to combine fertilizer
 use with improved seed.
 We also see that the proportion of households that bought seed was higher
 among farmers where the video was shown the both spouses together, but
 the difference is not significant after adjusting for multiple hypothesis
 testing
\begin_inset Note Note

 As such, while the information provided thought the video seems more effective
 if targeted at the couple for some inputs and practices, this finding can
 not be generalized as is also evident from the fact that the adoption index
 does not significantly differ between the two groups.

We next turn to changes in production related outcome as a result of our
 experiment.
 We first look at household level maize production.
 During the endline survey, we asked both spouses separately to estimate
 how much maize was harvested from each plot.
 These quantities were then summed over the different plots for each spouse
 and the average between the two spouses was taken as the final estimate
 of household level maize production.
 We find that overall, a typical farm household in our sample produced about
 460 kgs of maize.
 Households produced this on 1.13 acres on average.
 Taken together, we find that yields, defined as kilograms per acre, amounted
 to on average 470 kilograms per acre.
 This is much higher than yields recorded at baseline (290 kg/acre) as the
 rains were better and there was increased attention for strategies to combat
 fall armyworm.
 Still, compared to FAOSTAT figures (1000 kg/acre) or figures from household
 survey data (typically around 600 kg/acre), yields were below normal, as
 is also confirmed by the fact that in only 40 percent of households at
 least one spouse reported that yields were better than a typical year on
 at least one plot.

\begin_layout Standard
Table

 reports results for the three hypotheses with respect to outcomes related
 to production.
 In the top panel we again compare outcomes of control households to outcomes
 of households where at least one individual was shown a video (corresponding
 to hypothesis H1).
 Household level production, expressed in logs and trimmed 5 percent at
 each end of the distribution, does not differ between the two groups.
 We do find, however, that households that were exposed to the agricultural
 extension video seemed to cultivate smaller plots: Reported acreage is
 11 percent smaller among households that were shown a video.
 The fact that the same amount is cultivated on a smaller area also resulted
 in the fact that in households that were shown a video, yields were almost
 14 percent higher than in control households.
 Overall, we find that the information intervention had a significant and
 positive effect on production outcomes, as is evident from the positive
 treatment effect in the production index.
 We can conclude that, at the household level, the videos thus seemed to
 positively affect the intensification of maize.
 Again, this can be traced back to the fact that in the video, it is emphasized
 that it is better to combine inputs and practices, and that as such, it
 is often better to start small.
 In addition, the video promotes a more commercial attitude towards farming,
 where investments are made at a small scale to be scaled up over time.
 Comparing production outcomes between households where the video was shown
 to only one individual and households where the video was shown to the
 couple, we find no impact.
 Similarly, we do not find that it matters for production whether the informatio
n was given by an individual or by a couple.

We find some evidence that the video intervention also affected disposal.
 We find that among the control households, 83.2 percent of households reported
 that they consumed part of their harvest.
 The relatively high share illustrates the importance of maize as a food

 We find that this proportion increased by 4.1 percentage points in the sub-sampl

 The video promotes two types of improved seeds, and while one of them can
 in principle be recycled, best results are obtained by buying new seed

Impact on household welfare
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at the impact of the information interventions on measures
 of well-being at the household level.
 Welfare is captured though self-assessment, as well as though consumption.
 We have asked these questions only to the woman within the household, as
 we assume she has a better idea of consumption expenditure within the household
 and the general level of well-being.
 First, we asked if they feel their household is better off (as opposed
 to equally well off or worse off) in terms of income and consumption than
 the average households in their community.
 We find that among the control group, about 43 percent of households felt
 they were better off than average (top panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact_welfare"

\end_inset

).
 This percentage was 47.1 among households that received the video intervention,
 but the difference was not statistically significant.
 Similarly, we asked the female in the household to indicate if they thought
 they were better off than six months ago.
 We find that among the households that did not get the agricultural extension
 video, 41.4 percent of households indicated they did better than half a
 year earlier, and this percentage wa 44.3 among the households that did
 get to see the video.
 Also here, the difference is not significant.
 We also include standard self assessed food security questions
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Where are these taken from
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We asked if households were generally able to eat their preferred food,
 but did not find any difference between treatment and control.
 We also asked if households were generally able to eat enough food.
 We find that in the group that was exposed to the video, less households
 reported that they had sufficient food, but the difference is not significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a less subjective way to asses changes in well-being, we collected data
 on consumption.
 In particular, we asked the woman in the household about the value of the
 most consumed items, including auto-consumption.
 These included consumption of maize, cassava, sorghum, millet, rice, sweet
 potatoes, beans, fruits, groundnuts, vegetables, salt/sugar, cooking oil/ghee,
 soap, and airtime
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Even though these consumption categories were carefully chosen on the basis
 of consumption expenditure data from representative surveys in the area,
 we agree they may not capture everything and the estimates are likely to
 be too low.
 In addition, it may be that the intervention affected the composition of
 consumption, and farmers that had seen the video may have started consuming
 more of a food category that we did not measure, suggesting their consumption
 did not change.
 Care should thus be taken when interpreting this variable.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 From this we then took the logarithm and trim 5 percent at each end of
 the distribution.
 Results indicate that there was no difference in consumption between treated
 and control households.

We further test the hypothesis that households that were shown the video

 We find that about 42.9 percent of households in the group where only one

 the average household in their community.
 This percentage increased to 47.2 percent if the video was shown to couples

Impact on decision making
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the objectives of this study is to investigate if small changes in

 In particular, we want to make agricultural advisory services more inclusive

 In this section, we report differences in how spouses deal with disagreement
 related to maize production as a consequence of varying the recipient (H2)
 and the messenger (H3).
 We also report differences in who makes the decisions with respect to technolog
y adoption at the plot level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the endline, we asked each spouse to describe what happens if they
 disagree about any maize related issue.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Agreement-about-maize"

\end_inset

 reports that about 41 percent of men in households where the video was
 not shown to the couple together will generally tell their wife they do
 not agree about any maize related issue.
 Showing the video to a couple instead of to an individual increased this
 by about 3.7 percentage points, but the difference is not statistically
 significant.
 Among households where only one of the spouses was shown a video, the likelihoo
d that the women will tell the husband that she disagrees was slightly lower
 at 38.3 percent.
 However, if the video was shown to the couple, there was a significant
 increase in this percentage.
 Combining these two answers, we constructed an indicator that is true if
 both spouses indicate that they would generally tell the other if they
 do not agree about any maize related issue.
 We find that in households where recipients were individuals about 24.3
 percent of spouses told each other if they disagree.
 Among households where the video was shown to the couple, this percentage
 increased to 28 percent, but the difference is not significant at the 5
 percent significance level after adjusting for multiple comparisons

We next compare households that have seen the video where information was
 given by either a man or a woman to households where information was provided
 by a couple.
 We see that in half of the households where the messenger was an individual,
 the man will tell the wife if he disagreed about any maize related issue.
 This percentage was significantly lower among households where the messenger
 was a couple
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Why? Do we have an explanation for this??? Could this maybe be that after
 seeing a couple in the video, the husband thinks the wife is entitled to
 her own opinion or her own way of doing things?
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Changing the messenger attribute did not seem to have an effect on the
 likelihood that the woman told the husband that she does not agree.
 Among 49 percent of households where the version of the video was shown
 where an individual gave the information, both husband and wife indicated
 they will generally tell each other if they do not agree.
 This was 3.8 percentage points higher among households that were shown the
 version of the video where the information was given by a couple, but this
 difference is not significant at the 5 percent significance level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next question was a follow-up question on the previous one and inquires
 about what happens when one of the spouses told the other spouse that he
 or she disagreed about a maize related issue.
 As such, this question was not asked to individuals that stated in the
 previous question that they did never tell their spouse if they disagreed
 about maize related issues (281 men and 307 woman).
 As outcome, we computed the proportion of households in which the husband,
 the wife, or both responded that they talk and come to a conclusion that
 suits both, as opposed to situations in which the spouse either ignored
 the other or simply did what the other spouse commanded.
 Results are in the lower panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Agreement-about-maize"

\end_inset

.
 We found that in 72 percent of households that have been shown the video
 at the individual level, the man stated that if he disagrees with his wife,
 they will discuss the issue and come to a mutually satisfying solution.
 This percentage increased to 74.7 percent if the video was shown to a couple,
 but the increase is not significant.
 In 68 percent of households that have been shown the video at the individual
 level, the woman will discuss issues with the man if she did not agree
 and she said they will come to a mutually satisfying solution.
 This proportion increased by almost 7 percent, to 72.5, if the video was
 shown to both spouses together, and the adjusted p-value is just below
 the significance threshold
\begin_inset Note Note

\end_inset

.
 The likelihood that both spouses indicated that if they disagree they talk
 and come to a common solution is almost 8 percent higher when the video
 was shown to a couple, but again, the difference is not significant.
 Overall, the index supports the conclusion that showing a video to a couple
 increases the likelihood that spouses will try to find a mutually satisfying
 solution when there is disagreement compared to when a video is only shown
 to one of the spouses.
 We did not find differences in spouses consulting each other conditional
 on who provided the information in the video.

We also looked at decision making on the adoption of different maize growing
 practices and the use of inputs.
 For each of the practices and inputs applied at plot level, we asked both
 spouses who decided to use the input or practice.
 Options included that (i) the husband made the decision to use a particular
 technology alone, (ii) that the wife took the decision to use a particular
 technology alone, or (iii) that both husband and wife jointly decided to
 use a particular technology.
 Based on this, we constructed plot level indicators for these three categories
 of decision making and compared differences between treatment groups.
 Results are summarized in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Dec_tech"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We looked at decision making on nine practices, corresponding to the adoption
 practices reported in Tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_h1_ag"

\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_h3_ag"

\end_inset

.
 In particular, we asked who made the decision to start planting at a particular
 point in time on each plot (
\emph on
time plant
\emph default
).
 We also asked how made the decision to adopt the particular spacing that
 was used on each maize plot (
\emph on
space
\emph default
).
 After we asked what was done to fight striga on the plot, we also asked
 who made the decision on how to do this (
\emph on
striga
\emph default
).
 Similarly, after asking when first weeding was done, we asked who took
 the decision to do first weeding at that particular time (
\emph on
time weed
\emph default
).
 For fertilizer use (
\emph on
use fert
\emph default
), seed use (
\emph on
seed
\emph default
), whether seed was bought (
\emph on
bought seed
\emph default
) and the use of chemicals (
\emph on
chem
\emph default
), we only asked who made the decision if the particular technology was
 used.
 For instance, if a household member told us that DAP/NPK, Urea or organic
 fertilizer was used on a particular plot, we asked who made the decision
 to use this particular fertilizer on the plot.
 For seed use, we also inquired about who took the decision to use that
 particular seed.
 As the decision to combine seed and fertilizer was based on the two previous
 answers, this variable was also only available for plots where both fertilizer
 and improved seeds were used.
 We did not ask who took the decision to hire in labour.
 We also construct an indicator for overall decision making based on decision
 making on the individual practices and inputs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Agreement-about-maize"

\end_inset

, we only compare households where the recipient was an individual to households
 where the recipient was the couple (corresponding to H2, first three columns
 in the table) and compare households where the messenger was an individual
 to households where the messenger was a couple (corresponding to H3, columns
 four to six in the table).
 For example, the first column in the top panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Dec_tech"

\end_inset

 shows that among households where the video was shown to a single spouse,
 on about 32 percent of the plots, the husband made the decision on what
 spacing to use (first column).
 This was about 3.5 percentage points lower in households where the video
 was shown to the couple (second column), and the difference is significant
 (RI based p-values are in the third column).
 Similarly, with respect to the timing of the first weeding, the likelihood
 that this was decided unilaterally by the man in the household reduced
 after the video was shown to the couple.
 If fertilizer was used on the plot, this was decided by the man on 26.7
 percent of the plots in the sample of households where the video was shown
 to only one of the spouses.
 Among households where the video was shown to the couple, the man only
 decided on fertilizer use on 21.7 percent of the maize plots.
 The likelihood that the husband alone decided to buy seed was also lower
 in households where the spouses were jointly screened the video.
 In general, and confirmed by the decision index, showing a video to a couple
 significantly reduces the propensity that the husbands makes adoption decision
 by himself as compared to cases where the video was shown to only one individua
l.
 For the comparisons in decision making between households where the messenger
 was an individual to households where the messenger was a couple, we can
 again be very brief: we did not find any significant difference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second panel below shows results for female decision making related
 to the technologies.
 Not surprisingly, women are generally less likely to make decisions themselves
 on plots, and thus the percentages were much lower.
 For instance, while on about 24.1 percent of the plots the husband reportedly
 made the decision on what to do against striga, the wife decided on how
 to fight striga on only 12.7 percent of the plots.
 Also here, we find that showing a video to a couple reduced the likelihood
 that the woman takes decisions alone as compared to households where the
 video was shown to an individual.
 For instance, while women solely took the decision on spacing on about
 17 percent of the plots in households where the video was shown to an individua
l, this reduced to 14.2 percent in households where both households were
 shown the video together.
 Women alone decided on less then 10 percent of plots which improved seed
 to use in households where the information was given to only one individual.
 This reduce to a mere 5.6 percent among households that received the treatment
 together.
 We also see significant reductions in the likelihood that a woman alone
 decided on combining seed and fertilizer and on decisions related to the
 purchase of seed when the household is exposed jointly to the agricultural
 information video.
 As in the previous case, we also do not find any significant effect of
 changing the messenger in the video on the likelihood that decisions are
 taken by the woman alone.

The third panel reports the proportions of plots where decisions related
 to particular technologies were taken by the husband and the wife jointly.
 We see that joint decision making was generally more likely when the video
 was shown to the couple, but the difference is significant for only two
 variables.
 First, while husband and wife jointly decided on how to fight striga on
 20.3 percent of plots in households where the video was shown to only one
 of the spouses separately, this percentage increased by 3 percentage points
 in the sample of households that were shown the video together.
 We also find that, among households that reported using fertilizers, the
 proportion of plots on which it was jointly decided which fertilizers to
 use was significantly higher among the subgroup that saw the video joinlty.
 Second, while 17.5 percent of households in the group where the video was
 shown to only one individual report that they both decided to buy seed,
 this was 3.4 percentage points higher among the households where the video
 was shown to the couple.
 We did not find any significant effect of changing the messenger in the
 video on the likelihood that decisions are taken by the both spouses together.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Impact on adoption by plot manager
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous section, we have investigated the impact of the video interventi
ons on who decides about agricultural technology adoption.
 Here, we go one step further and test if the actual decision that was made
 differs between the different treatment groups conditional on who makes
 the decision.
 In particular, here, we investigate if the impact of a particular video
 intervention in terms of technology adopted is different if (i) the husband
 is the primary decision maker, (ii) the wife is the primary decision maker
 and (iii) decisions are made by husband and wife jointly.
 Results are in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adopt_manager"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the top panel of the table, we compare treatment and control households
 (corresponding to H1).
 In the first three columns, we report results on plots where the husband
 indicated he made the particular decision alone.
 For instance, we find that in the control group on 19.8 percent of plots
 where the man indicates he made the decision on when to start planting,
 planting was started immediately after the first rain as recommended in
 the video.
 This percentage does not differ significantly from male managed plots in
 the group that did see the video.
 Similarly, we find that the spacing that is recommended in the video was
 used on only 2 percent of plots where men made the decision with respect
 to spacing among control households.
 We find that this percentage increases by 5.4 percentage points in the sub-sampl
e that did get to see a video.
 On 69.8 percent of the plots where men decide on how to manage striga, recommend
ations were followed in the control group.
 This proportion increased to 82.2 percent among households that were shown
 the video.
 There is no difference between treatment and control groups in terms of
 optimal timing of first weeding on plots where men make the decisions.
 Furthermore, among the sample of households that did not get the agricultural
 extension information video, fertilizer was used on 28.8 percent of male
 managed, and this percentage is similar on male managed plots in households
 that did get the information treatment.
 We also find no difference between treatment and control for in adoption
 on male managed plots of seed use, on the likelihood that seed and fertilizers
 are combined or on seed recycling.
 We do find that our videos appear to crowd in the use of chemicals on male
 managed plots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The generally positive treatment effects of the video on practices on male
 managed plots do not seem to extend to women managed plots (reported in
 columns 4-6).
 We find no significant differences for the use of recommended spacing or
 the use of the recommended way to fight striga on female managed plots,
 nor are households that have seen the video more likely to use chemicals
 on their female managed maize plots.
 One interesting difference relates to fertilizer.
 Here, we do see that showing a video substantially increases the likelihood
 that fertilizer is used on women managed plots.
 The effect is also present on plots that are managed by husband and wife
 together (columns 7-9).
 On plots that are jointly managed, the likelihood that optimal spacing
 is adopted also increases by 6.2 percentage points after being shown a video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:adopt_manager"

\end_inset

, we compare plot level adoption outcomes between households in which the
 video was shown to one of the spouses and households where the video was
 shown to the couple, differentiating by who manages the plot (corresponding
 to H2).
 Since in this treatment we aim to reduce inequality between spouses, we
 would expect adoption rates on male and female managed plots to move in
 opposite directions.
 At the same time, we would expect an increase in the adoption of practices
 on plots that are jointly managed.
 There are indications that the former mechanism is at work for striga managemen
t.
 Among households where the video was shown to an individual spouse, on
 almost 80 percent of female managed plots striga was removed before flowering,
 while this was only the case on about 74 percent of male managed plots.
 After information asymmetries were removed by showing the video to both
 spouses, the proportion of male managed plots on which the recommended
 way to fight striga is followed increase by 8.3 percentage points.
 When the video was shown to an individual instead of a couple, male managed
 plots seem to get priority for weeding: on about 28 percent of male managed
 plots, first weeding was done according to recommendation provided in the
 video, while this is the case for only about 18 percent of female managed
 plots.
 However, in households where the video was shown to the couple, the percentage
 of women managed plots where proper weeding practices were followed increases
 by more than 10 percentage points.
 For fertilizer, we see a particularly strong effect of showing the video
 to couples on adoption on jointly managed plot, increasing an already high
 percentage by another 16.7 percent.

Impact on production by plot manager

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:disag_prod"

\end_inset

 we look at how production is affected by our video intervention, also separatel
y for male, female and jointly managed plots.
 Here, plot management is defined by the person who decided that maize should
 be cultivated on the particular plot.
 We find that the intervention increased production, reduced area planted
 and increased maize yields most convincingly on male managed plots.
 On female managed plots, the intervention only results in a smaller cultivation
 area.
 On plots that are jointly managed, results are closer to those on male
 managed plots, but only the yield increase is significant.
 Looking at these results together with findings in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, it may be that in the context of the fall armyworm crisis, the use of
 chemicals was key to convert increased fertilizer use into higher yields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing households where the video was shown to an individual with households

 by a couple on production outcomes disaggregated by plot manager.

\begin_layout Section*
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a world characterized by incomplete and asymmetric information, targeted
 efforts to fill knowledge gaps can make a big difference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "banerjee2011poor"

\end_inset

.
 However, not every information campaign is equally effective, and often,
 seemingly small attributes, such as the way a message is framed, how it
 is delivered, who is targeted by the message and who delivers the message,
 can result in significant differences in impact.
 Understanding and quantifying the importance of each of these design attributes
 through rigorous evaluation research should therefore be an essential part
 of any knowledge exchange model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In thus study, we evaluate the effectiveness of Information and Communication
 Technology (ICT) mediated short video messages to disseminate agricultural
 extension information, an intervention that can be brought to scale relatively
 easily and at significantly lower cost than alternative modes of agricultural
 extension information provisoin.
 In addition, and motivated by the observation that most agricultural advisory
 services are biased toward men, this study looked at two gender related
 attributes of a stylized ICT mediated agricultural extension information
 campaign.
 The first attribute consists of the gender composition of the person or
 persons that provide the information.
 The second attribute is the gender composition of the person or persons
 to which the information is targeted.
 This allows us to test three hypotheses related to (1) the overall effectivenes
s of the information intervention (2) the role of information asymmetries
 within the household; and (3) the effectiveness cooperative approach to
 farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The various hypotheses are tested using a field experiment where the messenger
 of the information and the recipient of the information is randomly altered
 according to a 3 by 2 factorial design.
 The study population were maize farmers in Eastern Uganda, from which we
 sampled about 3,600 farmers.
 These farmers were then shown a video according to the treatment group
 they were randomly assigned to.
 The videos showed how inputs and improved farming practices can be used
 to increase production.
 It also explains important concepts in inter-temporal decision making.
 The messages are also packaged in an attractive way, with role model farmers
 explaining how intensification of maize production improved their lives.
 The videos were shown twice, once just before the the planting season,
 and once during planting stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the information campaign increased knowledge about recommended
 agricultural practices and about how to invest in farming.
 Especially if the information is about a new technology and it can be assumed
 that previous knowledge is limited, we find substantial knowledge effects
 that can be attributed to the intervention.
 We do not find a difference in household level knowledge depending on whether
 the information was targeted to the couple or to an individual within the
 household.
 We also do not find that farmers learn more if the information is brought
 by a couple as opposed to by either a man or a woman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also find that the video messages lead to the adoption of many of the
 practices and technologies that were promoted in the video.
 Households that were exposed to the video are more likely to fight striga
 according to recommendations and to use a new way of spacing that was illustrat
ed in the video.
 Also, we find that farm households reduce use of DAP/NPK and increase use
 of urea and inorganic fertilizer.
 Most likely, this is due to the fact that, in the video, it is emphasized
 that inputs should be combined to get best results, and as a result some
 of the treated farmers reduce their use of DAP or NPK and increase adoption
 of Urea and inorganic fertilizer to engage in more balanced soil nutrient
 management.
 We also find that for some inputs and practices, adoption is more likely
 if information is delivered to husband and wife jointly, but care should
 be taken when trying to generalize this finding to other practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further down the potential impact pathway, we also find evidence that showing
 a video led to an increase in maize yields of almost 14 percent.
 Most of this is driven by a reduction in area cultivated, which is again
 consistent with the message in the video to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

start small
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We also find significant effects on disposal, with households that were
 exposed to the video more likely to consume maize and keep less maize as
 seed for the next season.
 In general, we did not find significant differences between households
 where the video was shown to an individual and households where the video
 was shown to the couple.
 Furthermore, despite the impact on production, we did not find any impact
 on welfare, either measured as consumption expenditure or self-assessed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do see interesting differences from targeting either the individual or
 the couple in the household if we start looking at decision making processes
 within the household.
 For instance, we find that showing a video to a couple increases the likelihood
 that spouses will try to find a mutually satisfying solution when there
 is disagreement compared to when a video is only shown to one of the spouses.
 Showing a video to a couple also significantly reduces the propensity that
 spouses makes adoption decision by him/herself as compared to cases where
 the video was shown to only one individual.
 It also increases the proportion of plots on which decisions are made jointly,
 at least for some practices and technologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at the impact of the interventions on adoption and production
 for male managed, women managed and jointly managed plots separately.
 We find that showing a video does not increase fertilizer use on male managed
 plots, but does so on female managed plots and plots that are managed by
 husband and wife together.
 Reducing information asymmetries within the household by targeting husband
 and wife jointly reduces differences in adoption rates between male and
 female managed plots for some practices and increases adoption on jointly
 managed plots for others.
 However, we only find effects on productivity on male managed plots and
 on jointly managed plots.
 It may be that, in the context of the fall armyworm crisis, the use of
 chemicals may have been key to convert increased fertilizer use into higher
 yields, and women appear to have less access to chemicals for use on the
 plots they manage.
 We find no evidence of a couple role model effect among Ugandan smallholder
 maize farmers.
