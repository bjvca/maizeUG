Designing for Effectiveness and Inclusivity in ICT-enabled Agricultural
 Extension: Evidence from Uganda

\begin_layout Abstract
In programs to disseminate information through agricultural extension and
 advisory services, seemingly small design attributes—the way the information
 is delivered, who delivers the information, or who is targeted by the message—c
an result in significant differences in the intervention's effectiveness
 and inclusiveness.
 Information and communications technology (ICT) can reduce the costs associated
 with adapting design attributes to particular problems and contexts.
 This study compares the effectiveness of different ICT-enabled technologies
 in providing agricultural extension services to smallholder farmers.
 In addition, it assesses the extent to which gender inclusivity in extension
 service provision can be influence by the gender composition of the person(s)
 who provide(s) the information and the gender composition of the person(s)
 who receive(s) the information in an ICT-enabled approach.
 Our study relies on a field experiment conducted among smallholder maize
 farmers in Uganda.
 The effectiveness of changing key design attributes—ICT technology, messenger,
 and recipient—is assessed by measuring knowledge gained, adoption of modern
 inputs and recommend practices, maize production and disposal, and well-being.
 The inclusivity of changing key design attributes is assessed by examining
 gender-disaggregated outcomes such as adoption and production on male-,
 female-, and jointly-managed plots, as well as intra-household decision-making.
 We find that short video-based extension messages increase knowledge, technolog
y adoption, and production at the household level.
 We find that a technology that is more demand driven further increases
 productivity, as farmers use it to obtain additional information on more
 complex technologies such as hybrid seed.
 Showing extension videos to both men and women (instead of only to men)
 increases women's knowledge, boosting their confidence and leading to more
 consultation among spouses.
 If women receive information, they make decisions (and adopt recommended
 technologies) on more plots, significantly increasing their role in maize
 production.
 However, this effect disappears if men also receive this information.
 Changing the messenger attribute does not have any effect on outcomes.

Often, the poor appear to make sub-optimal decisions because they lack critical
 pieces of information, are unable to benefit from learning externalities

 In many instances, information campaigns designed to address these information
 inefficiencies can lead to significant differences in an individual's decision-
making

.
 In the context of agricultural technology adoption among smallholder farmers,
 information inefficiencies are particularly important, as a lack of information
 about the existence, use, and profitability of modern inputs, improved
 technologies, and recommended management practices are a major constraint
 to productivity growth, sustainable intensification, and food security

.
 As such, agricultural extension programs and advisory services—often provided
 as a public service—are viewed as necessary to improving agricultural outcomes,
 especially in developing countries.
 Yet outcomes of many extension efforts are mixed at best

\begin_layout Standard
With new possibilities offered by information and communications technology
 (ICT), an abundance of pilot projects and commercial products have entered
 the market with a focus on revitalizing agricultural extension in developing
 countries.
 However, a growing body of evidence suggests that not all ICT-mediated
 extension approaches are equally effective in achieving outcomes such as
 increased rates of technology adoption, higher crop yields, or improvements
 in household welfare and intra-household equity.
 This may be because seemingly small design attributes—the way information
 is delivered, who delivers the information, and who was targeted—can significan
tly influence these outcomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper investigates the effectiveness and inclusivity of an ICT-enabled
 extension approach designed to provide information about improved maize
 cultivation practices to smallholder farmers in Uganda.
 In a first part of the paper, we consider the specific ICTs through which
 the information is delivered to the farmer, and differentiate between (i)
 short audiovisual messages viewed on tablet computers that provide detailed
 inromation on improved maize cultivation; (ii) interactive voice response
 (IVR) systems that farms call into if the need for additional information
 arises; and (iii) short message service (SMS) that nudge farmers at particular
 points in time about key farming practices they should apply.
 The outcomes used to assess the relative effectiveness of these different
 ICTs include increases in knowledge about improved maize cultivation by
 the subject farmer; and changes in household-level indicators such as the
 use of improved inputs, technologies, and practices; farm production and
 disposal; and well-being.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a second part of the paper, we explore the role and importance of gender-rela
ted attributes in the design of the ICT-mediated approach, focusing on (i)
 the gender composition of the recipient(s) of the information, and (ii)
 the gender composition of the messenger(s) providing the information.
 Experimental variations in these attributes allow us to assess the inclusivity
 of design attributes in extension provison.
 Specifically, we test hypotheses related to the influence of videos on
 information asymmetries within (dual) households, and the effectiveness
 of videos in changing certain customs, beliefs or gender stereotypes related
 to maize farming 
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A dual household is defined as a household containing both one male and
 one female member who take decisions as head of household either jointly
 or singly in their respective spheres of responsibility.
 It thus excludes single headed households or polygamous households.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 These gender-related outcomes are similarly assessed by examining knowledge
 gained at the individual level and the use of improved inputs, technologies,
 and practices at the household level, but also by examining changes in
 household decision-making processes and production outcomes on plots under
 male, female, and joint management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hypothesis testing and outcome estimations described above draw on a
 field experiment in which farmers were randomly assigned to a group that
 received a particular ICT-mediated information, and were then compared
 to a group that did not receive that particular information intervention
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2016field"

\end_inset

.
 Because we want to test more than one research hypothesis and are particularly
 interested in comparing the relative effectiveness of various design elements
 in an ICT-enabled extension approach, we opt for a factorial design.
 Generally, in factorial designs, a smaller sample size is needed to answer
 a fixed number of research questions as opposed to parallel designs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We work with 3,600 farm households sampled from the population of dual household
s cultivating maize across five districts of eastern Uganda.
 The core information interventions take the form of short videos that explain
 simple yet effective ways to increase maize productivity and profitability,
 such as recommended practices in row spacing, the importance of quality
 seed, optimal soil fertility management, and farm budget management.
 To test the overall effectiveness of the information provided through the
 video medium, we compare outcomes of farmers who were exposed to a placebo
 video to outcomes of farmers who were shown the informational video.
 In addition, we provided access to an IVR system to about two-thirds of
 the sampled households who were shown the informational video and, within
 that group, we sent about half of the sampled households a series of eight
 follow-up SMS messages at strategic points in time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test how information asymmetries within the household affects decision-making
 and outcomes, we compare households where the video was shown only to the
 man in the household (the status quo) to households where the video was
 shown to the woman alone in the household, and to households where the
 video was shown to the man and women together as a couple.
 To test the hypothesis on the importance of the gender (composition) of
 the person(s) providing the information, we produced different versions
 of the video.
 In each version of the video, the information content was exactly the same,
 only the person (or persons) featured in the video was changed.
 In one version of the video, all the information was provided by an individual
 male farmer; in a second version, the information was given by an individual
 female farmer; and in a third version, the information was given by a couple,
 with each spouse taking turns in the narration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the household level, we find that providing information to farmers through
 short video messages increases their knowledge about modern inputs, improved
 technologies, and recommended practices.
 In addition, farmers who were shown the video are also more likely to adopt
 a range of inputs, technologies, and practices that were presented in the
 videos.
 We also find clear effects on production with maize yields 14 percent higher
 than in control households.
 However, these results do not translate into greater well-being.
 We also find that the IVR generates no additional impact on knowledge,
 nor does it have a strong influence on technology adoption: we only find
 a positive effect of IVR on the uptake of hybrid seed.
 Still, we do find that households that were allocated to the IVR treatment
 report yields that are 8 percent higher.
 WE also find no effect from the SMS service.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With respect to who in the household receives the video message, there are
 few household-level effects.
 However, household-level effects may mask opposite effects at the individual
 level.
 We find that if the video is shown to the couple or to the woman (as opposed
 to only the man), knowledge of the woman increases significantly, suggesting
 information does not flow efficiently from the man to the woman within
 the household.
 When the video is shown to couple (as opposed to only the man), women are
 more likely to speak up if they do not agree, and it is more likely that
 an agreement is reached within the housheold.
 If women also receive information, men are less likely to make adoption
 decisions by themselves.
 Women, on the other hand, will make significantly more decisions on the
 use of improved agronomic practices and inputs, but only if this information
 is not also available to the husband.
 If only women receive information, they adopt more than if only men receive
 the information.
 As a result, we find that including women in this ICT-enabled extension
 approach increases the role of women in maize production.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, with respect to who the messenger is in the video, we do not find
 no signfiicant effects.
 This implies that it does not matter if the information in the video was
 provided by a man, a woman, or a man and woman together.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
 The next section lays out the main research questions and corresponding

 Section 3 explains the factorial design and corresponding sampling frame.
 Section 4 describes the study site and context, while Section 5 describes
 the interventions used as the treatment in this experiment.
 We then turn to the results in Section 6 with a discussion of baseline
 characteristics and sample balance.
 This is followed by analysis of the household level impact of the technology
 used, with subsections for impact on knowledge, practices adopted, production,
 and welfare.
 We then present an analysis of the gender and inclusivity dimensions of
 the study by first examining household-level outcome and then focusing
 more on individual-level outcomes and intra-household effects.

\begin_layout Section*
Research Questions and Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary focus of this study is to test alternative designs for improving
 the effectiveness and inclusiveness of agricultural extension services.
 We examine the relative importance of three design features: (i) the way
 the information is delivered through ICT channels, (ii) the gender composition
 of the messenger(s), and (iii) the gender composition of the viewer(s)
 in encouraging the uptake and adoption of modern input use and improved
 crop management practices.
 Specific emphasis is placed on exploring both the effectiveness and inclusivity
 of this ICT-enabled approach to extension information delivery for several
 reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we aim to contribute to the literature on how ICTs can incresae the
 uptake of improved management practices among smallholder farmers—a topic
 that has received considerable attention in recent years but has lacked
 sufficient evidence on which approaches work and for whom 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1111/agec.12314"

\end_inset

.
 The role of ICTs in improving access to information on crop management—as
 compared to improving access to market and price information—is a particularly
 challenging topic.
 Information of this kind is often non-excludable and non-rival in nature,
 requiring government intervention when it is under-supplied by the private
 sector.
 Government intervention typically takes the form of information campaigns,
 extension programs, and advisory services, many of which have been met
 with mixed success 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Feder2010,doi:10.1080/13892240903309595,doi:10.1080/13892249985300061,davis2008extension"

\end_inset

.
 These ambiguous outcomes are often associated with specificities of the
 technology, practice, or principle being promoted; the agroecological and
 socioeconomic context in which it is being promoted; and other confounding
 factors that may be poorly understood or too costly to address in program
 design and implementation..
 As a result, ICT applications to extension such as SMS reminders, purpose-built
 smartphone apps, portable tablets and projectors, and other hardware and
 software solutions have received considerable attention in recent years
 as a means of addressing many of these issues.
 Several studies have reported positive impacts of ICTs when applied to
 extension services.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "RePEc:hbs:wpaper:13-047"

\end_inset

 found that SMSs pushed to farmers in Gujarat, India generated positive
 effects on crop choice and pesticide-use decision, and that the introduction
 of an IVR system significantly increased cumin and cotton yields.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2016.1146700"

 found that a multi-media mobile phone-based product linked to expert advisory
 services increased farmers' awareness and knowledge about specific solutions
 to their production constraints in Madhya Pradesh, India.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, on the other hand, found that while mobile phone-based animated videos
 shown to farmers in Burkina Faso induced learning and understanding, it
 was no more effective in encouraging adoption than conventional approaches
 to information provision.
 In Uganda—the site of our study—Grameen Foundation had some success using
 smartphones to provide agriculture-related information to farmers through
 ICT-empowered community knowledge workers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/1369118X.2016.1200644"

\end_inset

, while others have shown successful pilots with both short videos 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1146/annurev-resource-100913-012714"

\end_inset

 and mobile-phone hotlines for farmers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:hbs:wpaper:13-047"

\end_inset

.
 However, it remains to be seen how far these effects can be generalized,
 and questions about cost-effectiveness, scalability, and accountability
 often remain unaddressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, we aim to address the issue of gender bias in the provision of agricultu
ral extension services and the dissemination of information to smallholder
 farmers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doss200127,FLETSCHNER20111422,peterman2011understanding,QUISUMBING2010581"

\end_inset

.
 Often, extension agents are male, and their default strategy for disseminating
 information is to target who they assume to be the main (or most accessible)
 decision-maker in a household, which is generally the man.
 HOwever, their underlying assumption that extension messages targeting
 one household member will spread to other household members—including women
 and youth who often play a substantial role in agriculture—may be false
 in many contexts 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:fpr:ifprid:1411"

\end_inset

.
 Men do not necessarily discuss production decisions or share information
 to women household members, especially if extension messages focus on men's
 priorities and crops 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fletschner2011gender"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "kabunga2012heterogeneous"

\end_inset

 find that female farmers are less likely to adopt tissue-culture banana
 technology in Kenya, but would have an equal chance to adopt the technology
 were they able to acquire sufficient information about it.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1093/erae/jbv039"

\end_inset

 investigate the effect of gendered approaches to extension training among
 farmers in South Kivu, DR Congo, and find that joint male and female participat
ion leads to the highest adoption rates for several key technologies and
 practices.
 Mechanisms that explain these effects focus largely on changes in relative
 bargaining power of the actors, gender-linked differences in access to
 complementary inputs, and overall intensity of exposure to information
 and training (see, e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Doss200127"

\end_inset

).
 Thus, evidence suggests that in certain contexts, gender homophily effects—in
 which men learn more from other men and women learn more from other women—may
 dominate other intra-household information-sharing effects 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doss200127"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, we explore the gender dimensions of crop production by investigating
 the extent to which farms are managed at the household level in a cooperative
 manner, e.g., through joint decision-making between and among male and female
 co-heads of household.
 We test whether bringing the messages as a couple or as a female leads
 to better outcomes than when the information is given by a man as would
 be the default case.
 We base this exploration on the assumption that social norms prevent women
 from playing a more prominent role in household agriculture.
 Gender stereotyping, where women are expected to tend to small gardens
 used to produce for home consumption and men are responsible for cash crops
 using inputs obtained from the market, may contribute to inefficient allocation
 of resources within the household as a single unit of production.
 This expands on recent research on how information campaigns can be used
 to change beliefs, norms, and perceptions—work that has been ongoing in
 public health and has only recently started to trickle through to other
 disciplines.
 It also expands on recent advances in the measurement of gendered dimensions
 of empowerment in agricultural households, including decison-making power,
 intra-household distribution of decision-making power and control over
 income and resources 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ALKIRE201371,MAHMUD2012610"

\end_inset

.
 We add to this body of work by specifically examining if women's involvement
 in maize farming can be increased by questioning cultural norms and influencing
 aspirations though ICT-enabled extension 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "RePEc:smu:ecowpa:1705,riley"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally and more broadly, we contribute to long-standing research efforts
 to document and measure the adoption and impact of improved agricultural
 technologies and management practices among smallholder farmers.
 There are many reasons for the observed low rates of adoption of improved
 technologies and practices among smallholder farmers, including lack of
 access to credit and insurance, poorly developed labour markets, and asymmetrie
s of information 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1086/451461,jack2013market"

\end_inset

.
 Our contribution is methodological in nature in recognition of two important
 points.
 First, too few studies apply sufficiently rigorous methods to address concerns
 about sample selection bias and causal identification in the study of technical
 change in developing-country agriculture 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2010recent"

\end_inset

.
 Second, too few studies on ICT-enabled extension are replicated in differing
 contexts and populations to increase both generalizable findings and nuanced
 insights on the impact pathways through which ICT operates on farmers'
 decision-making about technology adoption.
 Our study adds to this growing body of literature by adapting a design
 tha is similar to work in progress in Ethiopia 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "tanguydiggreen"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experimental design (described in detail below) allows us to explore
 these research questions by comparing outcomes between groups of randomly
 assigned farmers that are given the opportunity to view versions of a video
 on improved maize management practices in different configurations.
 In addition to the video, a random group of farmers also received a phone
 number and instructions to call into the IVR system.
 A final random subset of these farmers were also targeted by eight SMS
 messages reminding them at specific times about the application and use
 of important practices, and the fact that they can always call the IRV
 for additional information.
 The experiment allows us to test the following three hypotheses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
H1: Improving the provision of information to smallholder farmers results
 in increases in awareness and knowledge about improved technologies and
 practices, increases in the adoption of these technologies and practices,
 improvements in on-farm productivity gains, and improvements in household
 welfare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
H2: The effectiveness of information depends on who is targeted: jointly
 to male and female co-heads in a household or only the female co-head in
 the household as opposed to only to the male co-head.

The three hypotheses are tested with a field experiment.
 The experiment was implemented as a 3 by 3 factorial design to which a
 separate control group was added.
 In the first part of the study, where we look at the effectiveness of different
 ICTs in delivering information, we only concentrate on a single factor
 that has three levels (plus the control).
 The three levels are incremental and consist of (in addition to the pure
 control): (i) being shown a video (

 being included in the SMS reminder campaign (

 is illustrated in the top panel of Figure

 For the second part of the study, we use two different factors that are

 The first factor corresponds to the person(s) who provide the message (

 allows us to test the three hypotheses outlined above.
 To compare the different modes of information provision (H1), we start
 by comparing the average outcome among farmers in the control group to
 the average outcome of farmers that were shown a video, irrespective of
 who the video was shown to and who provided the information in the video.
 This gives us the average treatment effect for the video intervention.
 To get the additional effect of the IVR treatment, we compare average outcomes
 of households that were shown a video (irrespective of who the video was
 shown to and who provided the information in the video) to households that
 were shown a video and received the IVR intervention as well (irrespective
 of who the video was shown to and who provided the information in the video).
 Finally, the additional effect of the SMS campaign can be estimated by
 comparing outcomes of households that are shown a video and received the
 information about the IVR system to outcomes of household that were shown
 a video, received IVR information and also received the eight SMS reminders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test if information leads to more equitable outcomes when targeted to
 the female co-head or couple instead of the male co-head in the household
 (H2), we compare households where the female co-head only received the
 information (irrespective of who provided the information) to households
 where the information was given to the male co-head only (again, irrespective
 of who provided the information) and we compare households where the informatio
n was targeted to the couple (irrespective of who provided the information)
 to households where the information was given to the male co-head only
 (again, irrespective of who provided the information).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test if information leads to different outcomes depending on who provides
 the information (H3), we compare outcomes of farmers where the information
 was provided by a female actor only and outcomes of farmers where the informati
on was provided by a farmer-couple (i.e., a male actor and a female actor
 performing together in the video) to outcomes of farmers where the information
 was provided by a single male farmer performing in the video (the comparison
 group).

\begin_layout Standard
The sample size and its distribution over different treatment combinations
 was based on an elaborate series of power calculations.
 Instead of determining power analytically, we used simulation techniques.
 Simulation allows one to sample from actual data of outcome variables instead
 of relying on a theoretical distribution with an assumed mean and standard
 deviation.
 With this approach, it is also straightforward to build in flexibility,
 such as allowing for more than one treatment arm, or account for sampling
 design effects such as clustered sampling.
 Power calculations were based on two outcome variables, one that reflects
 efficiency at the household level (maize yield) and one that reflects inclusive
ness (the gender productivity gap, where women-managed plots are farmed
 less extensively than male-managed plots resulting in significantly lower
 yields).
 The power calculations and its underlying assumptions are described in
 great detail in the pre-analysis plan of this study.

\begin_layout Section*
Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conducted the field experiment among maize farmer in Uganda.
 Maize is widely consumed throughout much of Uganda, yet its value-to-weight
 ratio is sufficiently high to also make it an important traded commodity.
 Therefore, efforts to increase maize productivity at the farm-household
 level are an important dimension of Uganda's strategy to increase food
 security and reduce poverty through both consumption and income channels.
 Yet maize yields in Uganda are low when compared to neighbouring countries
 and global averages.
 While research station trials conducted in Uganda report potential yields
 of about 1.6 metric tons per acre (using only improved varieties without
 fertilizer application), data from the Uganda National Household Survey
 2005/06 indicate that average maize yields are much lower at about 618
 kg per acre for the main growing season of 2014.
 Moreover, there is considerable variation in productivity across farmers,
 with the top 10 percent of farmers achieving yields in excess of 1.1 metric
 tons per acre.
 At the same time, the use of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer
 and management practices such as row planting is very low in Uganda.
 For example, use of inorganic fertilizer average just 2.4 kg of nutrient
 per acre per year, compared to Kenya (75 kg/ac), Rwanda (70 kg/ac), and
 Tanzania (15 kg/ac).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maize is especially important in eastern Uganda.
 We sampled from five districts in eastern Uganda known for their maize
 production: Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo, and Namutumba.
 From this, we removed town councils and also two sub-counties that consisted
 of islands in lake Victoria.
 We used two-stage cluster sampling to obtain a representative sample of
 this population.
 In particular, we first selected parishes randomly and in proportion to
 the number of villages within each parish.
 In the selected parishes, all villages were included in the study.
 Within each village, we then listed all the households, from which we then
 sampled households to be included in the study.
 At the same time, we suspect that outcomes within villages will be correlated,
 for instance due to local weather conditions, or development programs that
 are implemented in certain areas.
 We therefore used the village as a blocking factor.
 In other words, in each village, we made sure all possible treatment combinatio
ns related to the 2 factors related to the messenger and recipient attributes
 (plus control) were administered.
 The experimental design described above shows that the messenger and the
 recipient factor combine into 9 different treatment combinations.
 Adding the control leads to 10 different households being selected in each
 village.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In eastern Uganda, there are two maize cropping seasons.
 For our study, we concentrated on the second maize-growing season, which
 runs from approximately August to January and is characterized by a shorter
 period of rains than the first maize-growing season.
 During this second season, the complete cycle from planting to harvest
 requires 3 to 3.5 months, and farmers tend to cultivate early-maturing but
 lower yielding maize varieties as a result.
 Fields are prepared in August, planted in September.
 Harvesting begins in mid to late December and, at higher elevations, can
 continue until mid January.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Intervention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main intervention used in the study were the videos that were shown
 on 10-inch Android tablet computers.
 Videos were screened by a trained field enumerator who sat with an individual
 farmer or a farmer-couple, depending on the household's random assignment
 to a treatment group.
 In accordance with the third factor in our factorial designs (varying the
 gender composition of the person(s) who provide the information), three
 videos were produced: one where the information was provided by a male
 farmer, one where the information was provided by a female farmer, and
 one where the information was provided by a couple (man+woman).
 Apart from varying this attribute of the treatment, the form and content
 of the three videos remained the same.
 The control group received a placebo treatment, which was a music video
 of traditional dancing that contained no information related to farming.
 Videos were screened twice to each farmer (or couple) in the sample, once
 before planing (July 2017) and once around planting time (August 2017).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information contained in the treatment groups' video is expected to
 positively influence maize yields by encouraging the adoption of several
 improved technologies and practices which, in turn, are expected to positively
 affect farm-household income.
 The topics included in the video script were obtained from qualitative
 interviews with key informants that were conducted in May 2017, and included
 maize farmers, value chain actors, maize breeders, extension workers, district
 agricultural officers, and other government staff and experts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main factors affecting maize productivity that were identified by these
 key informants were related to pests, poor soils, and poor seed quality.
 The three most important 
\series bold
pests
\series default
 that affect maize farming are striga (in particular the 
\emph on
Striga hermonihica
\emph default
 variety), maize stalk borer (
\emph on
Busseola fusca
\emph default
), and, more recently, fall armyworm (
\emph on
Spodoptera frugiperda
\emph default
).
 We focus on striga management in the videos because it was deemed more
 immediately problematic to our population of interest than maize stalk
 borer, and because, at the time this field experiment was conducted, there
 was no consistent strategy being promoted to address fall armyworm.
 Striga, also called whichweed, is a parasitic plant that feeds off the
 roots of maize, leading to severe stunting of the maize plant.
 Because the nutritional needs of maize are greatest at the early stages
 of growth, weeding of striga becomes less effective in curbing losses as
 the season progresses.
 Striga can reduce production from about 30 percent up to total loss of
 the crop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No single method is effective in controlling striga.
 Progress has been made in developing varieties resistant to the herbicide
 imazapyr and supplied with a imazapyr seed coating to contain striga before
 it can damage the host plant.
 However, the variety on offer in Uganda is expensive at 10,000 Ugandan
 Shillings (UGX) per kg
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At the time this study was conducted, the official exchange rate was approximate

 and does poorly under dry conditions and in areas where the rains are short
 such as in eastern Uganda.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the near future, it is expected that the same herbicide-resistance trait
 and seed-coating technology will be released in early-maturing varieties
 such as Longe 10, which are preferred in eastern Uganda.
 See https://striga.aatf-africa.org/.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Crop rotation with sweet potato or beans can also reduce striga infestation,
 as can applications of phosphatic fertilizer to make up for the nutrients
 drained by the parasitic weed.
 Weeding is also a strategy to control striga, and is most effective in
 the weed's earliest growth stages, before it establishes itself on the
 maize plant's root system and before it has a chance to spread via seed
 dispersal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Poor soils
\series default
, exhausted by continuous cultivation with little rotation, is the second
 main limiting factor.
 Soils often lack macro-nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P)
 and potassium (K), and farmers in our study area rarely use organic or
 inorganic fertilizers in sufficient quantities to ameliorate these deficiencies
, either at the planting stage (when diammonium phosphate (DAP) or NPK applicati
ons are recommended), or at the vegetative growth stage (when top dressings
 of nitrogenous fertilizers such as urea are recommended).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout eastern Uganda, maize farmers mainly rely on 
\series bold
seed saved from harvest
\series default
, which represents the third limiting factor identifying by key informants.
 The reliance on saved (recycled) seeds tends to negate the significant
 yield advantages conferred by high-yielding maize hybrids, which require
 that new F1 seed be purchased at the start of each season to realize the
 gains conferred by heterosis or hybrid vigor.
 And even where farmers rely on recycled seed from improved open-pollinated
 varieties (OPVs) that do not require seasonal replacement, the gains from
 improvement tend to depreciate over three to four season, again requiring
 farmers to purchase new seed at regular intervals.
 Gains from the improved genetic qualities of both maize hybrids and OPVs
 can increase yields between 30 and 200 percent, depending on climatic condition
s and the complementary use of modern inputs and intensive management practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, there are also
\series bold
 crop management practices
\series default
 that affect yields, but the effects are generally smaller than those related
 to improved seeds and inorganic fertilizer use.
 The most important are timely planting, optimal plant spacing, and timely
 weeding.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Timely planting
\series default
 in eastern Uganda implies that maize should be planted at the onset of
 the rains.
 However, many farmers delay planting for several reasons.
 For instance, they may not be certain that the rains have really started.
 There may also be bottlenecks in land preparation, where the poor are often
 the last in line for the use of oxen or tractors.
 Experts estimate that for each day a farmer delays planting, yields are
 reduced by 1.5 percent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Optimal plant spacing
\series default
 implies that sowing should be structured so that plants are are not too
 close to each other such that they compete for light and nutrients which,
 in turn, reduces yields.
 Plants that are too far from each other means space is wasted, also leading
 to lower yields.
 Related is the number of seeds that farmers plant in each hill.
 Farmers want to be sure of germination and put more than one seed, sometimes
 up to 5.
 If they all germinate, there is competition for nutrients and sun, resulting
 in stunted growth.
 Usually there is also not enough thinning, or this is done too late when
 competition has already occurred.
 One expert told us that standard spacing is 75cm x 60cm with two plants
 per hill.
 However, several experts mentioned a new way of plant spacing of 75cm x
 30cm with a reduced seed rate of 1 seed per hill which leads to a 35 percent
 increase in yields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Timely weeding
\series default
 implies that the first weeding should be done at 18-20 days after planting,
 with a second weeding at 2-3 weeks after first weeding.
 From emergence to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 stage (when the maize is at about knee height), the maize plant is a very
 poor competitor and unwanted stress such as weed competition must be prevented.
 A third weeding at the tasseling stage is optional, and depends on observed
 weed pressure after the second weeding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the above, a significant portion of the videos focuses on providing
 technical information on seed choice, soil nutrient management (including
 the promotion of both organic and inorganic fertilizer application), weeding
 (with particular attention on fighting striga), timely planting, and plant
 spacing.

Note that the videos did not include explicit information on the use of
 chemical pesticides which can be effective in addressing pests but may
 also be hazardous to humans, animals, and the environment.
 The decision to exclude such information was made following a determination
 by the study team that currently available content on pesticide use was
 insufficiently attentive to issues of safe handling, application, storage,
 and disposal of pesticides that are warranted in any study involving human
 research subjects.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We made sure to include information that is likely to be unknown to the
 farmer, based on findings from other studies that information is most valuable
 when individuals learn about a new technology or institutional innovation

However, not all constraints to maize productivity improvement are information
 asymmetries directly related to the use of inputs, technologies, and crop
 management practices.
 Often, missing information problems manifest indirectly, as uncertainty
 about the distribution of the farm-household's profit function.
 This includes uncertainty about the correlations between expected and actual
 returns, the inter-temporality of income streams, estimates of fixed and
 variable costs, hidden transactions costs, probabilities of adverse events,
 and a range of other variables that farmers may simply be unable to conceptuali
ze or measure

Farmers indeed often mention they do not use modern inputs because they
 have no money, suggesting liquidity is the main constraining factor, and
 thus instead of providing information, a more effective strategy would
 be to provide credit or subsidize inputs.
 Recent research, however, finds that despite what farmers claim, liquidity
 is often not the most important constraining factor.

 compare outcomes related to agricultural production between households
 that were given cash to households that were provided with insurance and
 find that when provided with insurance, farmers are able to find resources
 to increase expenditure on their farms.
 However, a recent study among rice farmers in Uganda does not find that
 providing objective information about the returns to different inputs and
 practices increased adoption

 Thus, a significant portion of the videos also focuses on the costs and
 benefits of the different technologies and practices being promoted.
 In addition, the videos encourage long-term thinking, advising farmers
 to (a) start small and grow their farm enterprise over time, and (b) combine
 technologies and practices together rather than investing all of their
 money and effort into one single input, practice, or technology.
 In short, we encourage them to experiment with combinations of technologies
 and practices on a small scale in the initial season before reinvesting
 their gains for larger-scale replication in subsequent seasons.

\begin_layout Standard
We also pay attention to how the information is packaged.

 conditions and constraints most comparable to their own to be the more

The video starts with the farmer-actor or -actors introducing themselves
 (recall that three versions of this video were produced: one where the
 farmer-actor is male; one where the farmer-actor is female; and one where
 a pair of actors, one male and one female, act together).
 The farmer talks about how she used to struggle with her maize gardens
 and how at one point in time, she decided things needed to change.
 It is shown how the farmer sells a hen, obtains a small loan from a friend,
 and uses these proceeds to buy small quantities of improved seed and fertilizer
 from a local retailer.
 The video then shows how the farmer prepares the garden by collecting and
 applying manure.
 Next, the video details how the DAP is applied correctly, how maize seed
 are spaced at 75cm x 30cm intervals with 1 plant per hill, and what the
 correct timing of these activities should be.
 The video progresses to a field about 10 to 12 days after sowing when the
 maize has emerged from the soil, and she recommends that the farmer engage
 in gap filling to replace seeds that did not germinate, thereby preserving
 optimal plant density.
 The video proceeds to the field at 18 to 20 days after sowing, and she
 recommends how weeding should be conducted with particular attention to
 the identification of striga and the importance of follow-up weeding two
 to three weeks later.
 The video then advances to four weeks after planting, where she demonstrates
 how urea top dressing is done and recommends one more round of weeding
 at the tasseling stage.

The video then turns to a discussion about investing to get higher yields
 over time.
 She points out that while it may be difficult to raise cash, viewers can
 always start small (e.g., on one tenth of an acre) and reinvest the returns.
 She then explains that following recommended practices and using improved
 inputs led her to produce 2.5 bags of maize on a small plot, which she sold
 for UGX 125,000 with a profit of almost UGX 90,000—as compared to harvested
 one bag from the same area at a profit of only UGX 40,000.
 She then explains that she reinvested the difference (UGX 50,000) to increase
 the area under intensive maize cultivation year after year such that, over
 time, she was able to cultivate an entire acre using modern inputs.
 In the final part of the video, she reiterates her experience and again
 encourages the viewer to try a similar approach.

The video is the only treatment used to test the hypotheses related to the
 messenger and the recipient effect.
 To investigate the relative effectiveness of the the technology, two other
 treatments were incrementally added to the video treatment.
 For these two treatments, the IVR system and the SMS messaging, we collaborated
 with viamo, a social enterprise that aims to connect individuals and organizati
ons using digital technology to make better decisions.
 We set up an IVR system that provided the same information as what we recommend
 in the video (eg.
 the new way of spacing, the same types of hybrid and OPV seed,...).
 Farmers that were allocated the the IVR treatment could call a toll free
 number, after which they heard a person explaining the system in their
 own language.
 Farmers are then invited to type a number corresponding to the topic on
 which they want more information (eg 1 for seed selection, 2 for spacing
 and seed rate, 3 for soil nutrient management, 4 for advice on weeding,
 5 for pest management).
 Depending on what number was selected, the IVR then played an audio message
 of a conversation between two farmers where one farmer is telling the other
 farmer the recommended practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the SMS campaign, we recorded telephone numbers for each household on
 which the household could be reached.
 Households that were allocated to the SMS treatment were sent eight SMS
 messages over the course of the 2 months following the first screening
 of the video.
 The messages all followed a similar structure, where farmers were first
 reminded about the important technology or practice that was relevant at
 the particular time that the message was sent, followed by a reminder about
 the existence of the IVR service.
 For example, the first message, that was sent out around planting time,

 We collected household characteristics such as household size, age, and
 education level of household head.
 We then asked more specific questions related to maize farming, such as
 acreage and quantities produced in the last season.
 Furthermore, we asked if the household received agricultural extension
 service, whether it used improved seed, and whether fertilizer was applied.
 We also collected data on housing conditions (number of bedrooms) and distance

In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance"

\end_inset

, we provide descriptive statistics and balance tests for the three hypotheses
 related to the ICT used to deliver the information.
 Averages for the entire sample are reported in the first column.
 We observe that few households that were included in our study had access
 to agricultural extension in the previous year (about 11 percent).
 We also observe that only about 20 percent of households reported to have
 used any fertilizer in the previous season and only about 38 percent reported
 to have used improved seed bought from a shop or agro-input dealer during
 the last cropping season.
 This suggests ample scope to increase intensification investments through
 extension.
 We also find that farmers produced on average only 286 kg of maize per
 acre in the first cropping season of 2017.
 This is substantially lower than the average yield of 618 kg per acre we
 find in data from the 2005/06 Uganda National Household Survey.
 The low yields may reflect the devastating impact of the Fall Armyworm
 outbreak in East Africa in 2017, but maybe also be the result of adverse
 weather conditions

\begin_layout Standard
Balance is demonstrated as differences between treatment groups for each
 characteristic as well as a joint significance test (F-test) for each of
 the three ICTs.
 The second column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance"

\end_inset

, denoted video, compares baseline characteristics between households that
 were shown the placebo video and household that were shown an intervention
 video.
 For example, we see that yields prior to the intervention are about 21
 kg per acre higher in the group that was shown the video than in the group
 that was not shown the video.
 However, as can be inferred from the p-value, this difference is not significan
tly different from zero.
 In fact, for the control versus treatment comparison, none of the differences
 between baseline characteristics is significant at the 5 percent significance
 level, and also the F-statistic can not be rejected.
 In the third column, differences in baseline characteristics between households
 that received the video and households that received IVR on top of the
 video are shown (indicates as +IVR).
 Here, we see that households in the latter group are significantly larger
 than households that only saw the video.
 They also have significantly more bedrooms.
 However, we can again not reject the null that jointly, baseline characteristic
s are unrelated to the treatment group for this comparison.
 For the final hypothesis related to the technology tested (comparing farmers
 that received video and IVR to those that additionally received SMS messages;
 reported in column four and denoted +SMS), we again find no significant
 differences in baseline characteristics, both for individual and joint
 comparisons.
 Overall, we conclude there may be some concern about balance when comparing
 the video only group to the video+IVR group, something we will further
 investigate when we look at the robustness of some of the results.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

We did not repeat averages here to conserve space and because, even though
 they are based on a slightly smaller sample size as we drop the control
 group, they are very similar to those reported in Table

\end_inset

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In the first two columns, the comparison group for the baseline characteristics
 is the subgroup of the sample where the video was shown to only the male
 co-head.
 In the first column, we see that among the subgroup where the female co-head
 was shown the video, the household head was significantly younger than
 in households where the video was shown to the male co-head.
 While the age of the head is about 42 in the sample where the video was
 shown to the man, it is only about 34 in the group where the woman was
 given the video treatment.
 We also find that household heads are significantly less educated in the
 sample where the recipient is the female co-head: while over 42 percent
 of heads had finished primary education at baseline in the group where
 the male co-head was assigned to receive the video treatment, the corresponding
 figure is only 26 percent among household where the female co-head was
 assigned to the video treatment.
 We also find less use of fertilizer and seed at baseline in the subgroup
 where women were shown the video when comapred ton households where men
 were shown the video.
 The fact that four out of nine comparisons turn out significant raises
 concern about balance for the comparison between the group where men were
 shown the video within the household and the group where women were shown
 the video, a fact that is also reflected in the significant F-test.

\begin_layout Standard
In the second column of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance_gender"

\end_inset

, we also find some indications of imbalance.
 Specifically, in the subgroup where the video was shown to a couple, households
 are significantly larger than in the subgroup where the video was shown
 to the male co-head only.
 We also find that in this subgroup, baseline fertilizer and improved seed
 use are lower than in households where the video was shown to the male
 co-head individually.
 Afain, orthogonality is rejected with a joint F-test.

In the last two columns of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance_gender"

\end_inset

, the comparison group now consists of households where the version of the
 video was shown in which the messenger in the video was male.In column three,
 baseline averages of the comparison group are compared to baseline outcomes
 for households where the messenger was female.
 We do not find any systematic difference in baseline outcomes between these
 two groups, and the F-statistic is also insignificant.
 In column four, baseline averages of the comparison group are compared
 to baseline outcomes for households where the information was provided
 by a couple.
 Also here, we do not find any meaningful difference in baseline outcomes
 between these two groups.

Impact of the ICT approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Knowledge effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first test the impact of the three different ICT interventions on knowledge.
 This was done through a short quiz 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "feder2004acquisition,feder2004sending,masset2015does"

\end_inset

 consisting of four questions that were asked during the endline survey
 to each of the two spouses separately.
 For each question, three possible answers were read out to the respondent,
 who was then asked to indicate which answer he or she though was correct.
 The respondent was also allowed to indicate if he or she did not know the
 correct answer.
 The household was considered knowledgeable on a particular topic if at
 least one of the spouses indicated a correct answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first question was related to planting.
 In our video, we recommended a spacing of 75cm x 30cm with 1 plant per
 hill, and this was the correct option.
 Other possible answers included a spacing of 75cm x 60cm with two plants
 per hill, which is standard for many farmers and recommended by many agricultur
al extension agents, and an intermediate alternative of 75cm x 30cm with
 2 seeds per hill.
 Because our video recommended a technique that deviates from what is assumed
 to be standard spacing, we assume that the recommended practice is new
 to most of the farmers.
 The second question is less related to technical knowledge, but more to
 viewing farming as a business.
 In the video, we paid ample attention to promoting an approach where farmers
 start small and grow over time by reinvesting, and we emphasized the benefits
 of combining inputs rather than investing only in e.g., improved seed.
 We want to see if farmers internalize this advice and ask what a successful
 farmer would do if he or she only has 40,000 shillings.
 The correct answer is to use this sum to purchased improved seed and fertilizer
 and start intensified farming on a small area.
 Alternative options were to: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

use all the money to buy hybrid seed, because without good seed, yields
 will be low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

use all the money to buy fertilizer, because with poor soils, yields will
 be low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For the third question, we asked if the farmer knew when weeding is most
 important.
 The corret answer is that weeding is most important during the first four
 weeks after planting, as maize is a poor competitor for light and nutrients.
 Alternative answers were: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when the maize is knee high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when the maize is at tasseling stage,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 both of which are assumed to be well-known pionts in time when farmers
 typically weed.
 Finally, we asked if farmers knew when spraying against Fall Armyworm is
 most effective.
 There was no information given about fighting Fall Armyworm in the intervention
, so unless one of our interventions encouraged farmers to search for additional
 information, we do not expect an impact.
 For this question, the correct option was: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

During the evening, as fall armyworm eats during night,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while the other options were: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Early in the morning when it is still cool
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 This, in addition to adjustments to the significance levels to account
 for Family-Wise Error Rates (FWER), guards against over-rejection of the
 null hypothesis due to multiple inference.
 We use re-randomization to construct the joint null distribution for the
 family of outcomes we are testing.
 From this family-wise sharp null, we can obtain the corresponding FWER-consiste
nt significance thresholds by determining which cuttoffs yield e.g., 5 percent,
 1 percent and 0.1 percent significant hypothesis tests across all tests
 and simulations.

 shows results for the three main hypotheses.
 In the top panel, denoted as 
\emph on
Video
\emph default
, we compare quiz results for households that were allocated to the control
 group and households that were shown a video, irrespective of who this
 video was shown to and who provided the information in the video
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For the comparison between different ways of delivering information to a
 household, we only keep households where the video was also shown to the
 man (as generally he will be the main decision maker).
 In other words, we removed households where the video was only shown the
 female co-head.
 Hence, the number of observations is smaller than what is reported in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Experimental-Design"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The first column reports the proportion of households in which at least
 one of the spouses was able to give the correct answer to the multiple
 choice question under consideration (with standard deviations reported
 in parentheses).
 In the second column, we report the difference between the control group
 and the households that were shown a video (with standard errors reported
 in parentheses).
 We find that in 16 percent of the households in the control group, at least
 one of the spouses gave the correct answer among the response options to
 the question on optimal maize seed spacing.
 This relatively low rate of correct responses is due to the fact that this
 is a fairly new and potentially controversial recommendation.
 We see that among households that were shown a video, the proportion increases
 by 15 percentage points, to over 30 percent, and this difference is statistical
ly significant.
 For the next question on input use, about 91 percent of households that
 were not shown the treatment video knew that is best to combine inputs
 instead of only using seed or fertilizer.
 Even though baseline knowledge is already high on this question, the video
 treatment further increased this knowledge by another 5.1 percentage points.
 For the question on weeding, we see that in about 95 percent of households
 in the control group, at least one of the spouses was able to correctly
 indicate that weeding is most important during the first four weeks after
 planting; the intervention does not seem to have a significant effect on
 knowledge about weeding
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In addition, our pre-analysis plan specified that we would drop from the
 analysis variables where 95 percent of outcomes are the same value to reduce
 the influence of outcomes with limited variation.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Finally, on the Fall Armyworm question, we find that households that were
 shown the video are no more likely than control housholds to know when
 one should spray to control the pest.
 This suggests that the videos did not encourage farmers to actively search
 information on important challenges that were not explicitly covered in
 the video.
 Overall, and as confirmed by the knowledge index, we conclude that the
 agricultural extension videos increased knowledge at the household level,
 and that this increase seems especially poignant for 
\emph on
new
\emph default
 information provided in the videos.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowh0HH"

\end_inset

, labeled 
\emph on
+IVR
\emph default
, compares knowledge outcomes for households that were shown the video to
 households that were shown the video and received the IVR treatment.
 The pure control group that received the placebo intervention is discarded
 from the analysis at this point.
 We do not find any significant supplemental impact of augmenting the video
 intervention with IVR.
 However, since we now only focus on households that already learned from
 the video intervention, we find that knowledge in the comparison group
 is already high: for both knowledge of the benefits of combining inputs
 and the timing of first weeding, about 95 percent of households in the
 comparison group know the correct answer.
 As a result, these findings may suffer from limited variation in the outcome.
 The third panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowh0HH"

\end_inset

, labeled 
\emph on
+SMS
\emph default
, compares knowledge in households that received both the video and IVR
 treatment to households that received the video, the IVR treatment, and
 the eight SMS reminders.
 Again, we do not find that the SMSs further increased the often already
 high levels of knowledge.

Adoption effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the endline survey, we collected detailed information on the use
 of modern inputs and recommended farming practices on maize plots.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_h1_ag"

\end_inset

 compares adoption rates for a range of technologies and practices between
 households in the control group that were shown the placebo video and household
s that were shown a video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first recommended practice we examine is early planting, which was emphasize
d in the video as an important determinant of maize yields.
 We find that in about 37 percent of households where the placebo video
 was shown, at least one spouse reported having started planting maize within
 one day of the first rains on at least one plot.
 This does not seem to be significantly different from the proportion of
 households that were shown the video who similarly reported planting immediatel
y after the rains.
 For the second recommended practice—reduced spacing between hills in a
 row and only one seed planted per hill instead of the usual two–we see
 that the percentage of control households in which at least one of the
 spouses reported uptake of this practiceon at least one plot is only 3
 percent.
 Among households that were shown the video, this percentage increases to
 11 percent and the increase is statistically significantly.
 We find a similar positive impact from showing the video for the removal
 of striga according to recommended practices.
 Almost 69 percent of control households report removing striga before it
 flowers to reduce damage early on and prevent the weed from spreading,
 this s percentage increases by 12 percent for households shown the video,
 although the difference is not significant at the 5 percent level after
 correcting for multiple comparisons.
 Finally, we find that about 43 percent of control households reported first
 weeding after 18-20 days as recommended in the video, and no increase in
 this percentage among households shown the video.

Next, we examine the effect of video-enabled extension on fertilizer and
 seed use on maize plots.
 Overall, in 45 percent of households in the control group at least one
 of the spouses reported using fertilizer on at least one plot.
 While this percentage is almost 25 percent higher among treated farmers,
 the difference is not significant at the 5 percent level after controlling
 for FWER.
 We further collected information on the use of improved seed on the maize
 plots.
 Improved seed is already relatively high, with 55 percent of control households
 reporting the use of either hybrid and/or open-pollinated varieties on
 at least one maize plot.
 Adoption rates of improved seed do not increase significantly after seeing
 the video.
 We also check if the proportion of households that combine improved seed
 with fertilizer increased after having been shown the video, as this is
 a point of emphasis in the intervention.
 While the percentage of households that report using both technologies
 increases by almost 25 percent, this difference is not statistically significan
t.
 The proportion of households that buy seeds on the market, as opposed to
 recycling used or saved seed, was also unaffected by the information treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then examine whether the intervention crowds in other technologies or
 practices 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.1257/aer.20150474"

\end_inset

.
 While we do not promote the use of chemicals such as fungicides, pesticides
 or herbicides in our video, their use rates may be indirectly affected
 as a result of the video's emphasis on intensifying production.
 We find that about 45 percent of control households used chemicals on at
 least one plot, and that this figure increases by about 14 percent higher
 among households that were shown the video.
 But again, the difference is not statistically significant.
 Finally, we examine whether the video increased the likelihood that households
 hire in labor as a result, for example, of more intensive management or
 higher output.
 While hiring in of labor seems common in our sample, the rate is not affected
 by the intervention.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results for the incremental impact of adding IVR services to the video intervent
ion are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_ivr"

\end_inset

.
 The addition of IVR does not seem to further increase adoption.
 While we do find that the adoption of improved maize seed is almost 8 percent
 higher when IVR is added to the video intervention (and this effect is
 also somewhat reflected in an increase in the proportion of households
 that reports to buy seed from the market), the difference is not statistically
 significant.
 Similarly, we find little impact of augmenting video and IVR with the SMS
 reminders (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:pract_sms"

\end_inset

).
 Even though fertilizer use is almost 10 percent higher among farmers that
 were targeted by the SMS reminders, the increase is not statistically significa
nt.

We can further disaggregate by type of fertilizer used.
 Results are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, where we again have three panels, one for each ICT added to the treatment,

.
 When estimating the impact of the video intervention, we see that among
 the control households, a substantial proportion (26 percent) are already
 using DAP or NPK on at least one plot.
 This proportion decreases among households that were shown the video, but
 the difference is not statistically significant.
 At the same time, the use of urea, as well as the use of organic fertilizer,
 seems to increase in response to the intervention.
 In particular, the use of urea, which was very low in the control group,
 more than doubled as a result of showing the video.
 Inorganic fertilizer use also increased substantially, from 16 percent
 in control households to 24 percent in households shown the video.
 Overall, these findings suggest that the video's emphasis on combining
 inputs—and thereby managing soil nutrients in a more balanced manner—led
 treated farmers to reduce their use of DAP or NPK and increased their use
 of urea (and to a lesser extent inorganic fertilizer).

In the second panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_fert"

\end_inset

, we see that the addition of IVR seems to discourage the use of inorganic
 fertilizer and increase the use of DAP/NPK (although the latter is not
 statistically significant after controlling for multiple comparisons).
 This may be because application of DAP or NPK is more complicated than
 urea or organic fertilizer, and so a demand-driven information service
 such as IVR may be more effective than showing a video.
 Finally, the third panel shows no additional effect of the SMS intervention
 on the use of particular fertilizers.

Similar to fertilizer, we disaggregate by type of improved seed used for
 households where at least one spouse reported to be using improved seed
 on at least one maize plot.
 Results are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact-of-technology_seed-1"

\end_inset

.
 We find that showing the video did not influence the type of improved seed
 used.
 However, providing access to the IVR service increases the likelihood that
 hybrid seed is used from 30 percent to 36 percent.
 This is consistent with the interpretation that for more advanced technologies,
 a demand-driven extension approach may be more effective.
 We find that hybrid seed use is lower among farmers that also received
 the SMS reminders.
 This is surprising: the first message actually states that yields are much
 higher if hybrid seed is used instead of recycled seed.
 However, it may be that farmers already started planting by the time they
 received the first SMS message.
 Also, the effect is not significant after controlling for FWER.

Production effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now turn to the intervention's effects on production-related outcomes.
 We first look at household-level maize production.
 During the endline survey, we asked both spouses separately to estimate
 how much maize was harvested from each plot.
 These quantities were then summed over the different maize plots for each
 spouse and the average between the two spouses was taken as the final estimate
 of household-level maize production.
 We find that overall, a typical household in our sample produced about
 460 kg of maize (first column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:yield_ag_allh"

\end_inset

) on an average of 1.13 acres, implying yields of 407 kg per acre.
 
\change_deleted 973716962 1530639654
Taken together, we find that yields, defined as kilograms per acre, amounted
 to on average
\change_unchanged
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
shouldn't this be 407 kg/acre?
\end_layout

\end_inset


\change_deleted 973716962 1530639661
470 kg per acre.

\change_unchanged
 This is much higher than yields recorded at baseline (290 kg/acre)
\change_inserted 973716962 1530639688
 for the previous season, possibly because 
\change_deleted 973716962 1530639689
 as 
\change_unchanged
the rains were better 
\change_inserted 973716962 1530639700
during our intervention 
\change_unchanged
and 
\change_inserted 973716962 1530639707
farmers may have given 
\change_deleted 973716962 1530639709

to combatting Fall Armyworm.
 
\change_deleted 973716962 1530639725

\change_unchanged
Still, compared to 
\change_inserted 973716962 1530639748
figures recorded in 
\change_unchanged
FAOSTAT 
\change_deleted 973716962 1530639737
figures 
\change_unchanged
(1000 kg/acre) or figures from household survey data (typically around 600
 kg/acre), yields were below 
\change_inserted 973716962 1530639770
what might be considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 in Uganda.
 This 
\change_deleted 973716962 1530639772
normal, as 
\change_unchanged
is also confirmed by the fact that in only 40 percent of households at least
 one spouse reported that yields were better than a typical year on at least
 one plot.

production-related 
\change_unchanged
outcomes
\change_deleted 973716962 1530639813
 related to production
\change_unchanged
.
 In the top panel we again compare outcomes of control households to 
\change_deleted 973716962 1530639825
outcomes of
\change_unchanged
 households that were shown the video.

level production, expressed in logs and trimmed 
\change_inserted 973716962 1530639837

\change_unchanged

 We do find, however, that households that were

shown the video 
\change_deleted 973716962 1530639857

 However, the difference is not significant at the 5 percent level after
 controlling for FWER.
 The fact that the same 
\change_inserted 973716962 1530639915
quantity of output was reported on 
\change_deleted 973716962 1530639919
amount is cultivated on 
\change_unchanged
a smaller area 
\change_inserted 973716962 1530639937
of land means that 
\change_deleted 973716962 1530639939
also resulted in the fact that in

 percent of households in the control group, at least one spouse indicates
 that yields were better than in a normal year on at least one plot.
 This is 2.7 percentage points higher among households that saw a video,
 but the difference is not significant.

\change_inserted 973716962 1530640129
 A statistically significant difference between treatment and control households
 is also evident when measured with the production index.

Overall, 
\change_inserted 973716962 1530640140

 outcomes
\change_inserted 973716962 1530640178
 and the intensification of maize production.
 
\change_deleted 973716962 1530640185
, as is evident from the positive treatment effect of the production index.
 We can conclude that, at the household level, the videos thus seemed to
 positively affect the intensification of maize.

Not sure if we really want to say this; if anything, we should be thinking
 about whether we can disentangle the effects of these two impact pathways,
 e.g., conditional on a hh's correct knowledge scores on the business-related
 question, do we see higher production-related outcomes associated with
 the video treatment?
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\end_inset


\change_unchanged
Again, this can be traced back to the fact that in the video, it is emphasized
 that it is better to combine inputs and practices, and that as such, it
 is often better to start small.
 In addition, the video promotes a more commercial attitude towards farming,
 where investments are made at a small scale to be scaled up over time.

\change_deleted 973716962 1530640395
while area planted reduces much less.
 
\change_unchanged
This may be explained by the fact that the IVR system is more focused on
 technical information on how to implement certain practices or apply certain
 technologies, instead of the more holistic message

Impact on household welfare
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at the impact of the information interventions on measures
 of well-being at the household level.
 Welfare is captured though self-assessment, as well as though consumption.
 We 
\change_deleted 973716962 1530640572
have 
\change_unchanged
asked these questions only to the woman within the household, as we assume
 she has a better idea of consumption expenditure within the household and
 the general level of well-being.
 First, we asked if they feel their household is better off (as opposed
 to equally well off or worse off) in terms of income and consumption than
 the average households in their community.
 We find that among the control group, about 40.1 percent of households felt
 they were better off than average (top panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Impact_welfare"

\end_inset

).
 This percentage was slightly higher among households that received the
 video intervention, but the difference was not statistically significant.
 Similarly, we asked the female in the household to indicate if they thought
 they were better off than six months ago.
 We find that among the
\change_inserted 973716962 1530640617

\change_deleted 973716962 1530640622

As a less subjective way to asses changes in well-being, we collected data
 on consumption.
 In particular, we asked the woman in the household about the value of the
 most consumed items, including

\change_inserted 973716962 1530640784

\change_unchanged

 These included consumption of maize, cassava, sorghum, millet, rice, sweet
 potatoes, beans, fruits, groundnuts, vegetables, salt/sugar, cooking oil/ghee,
 soap, and airtime

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Even though these consumption categories were carefully chosen on the basis
 of consumption expenditure data from representative surveys in the area,
 we agree they may not capture everything and the estimates are likely to
 be too low.
 In addition, it may be that the intervention affected the composition of
 consumption, and farmers that had seen the video may have started consuming
 more of a food category that we did not measure, suggesting their consumption
 did not change.
 Care should thus be taken when interpreting this variable.
\end_layout

 From this we then took the logarithm and trim

 Results indicate that there was no difference in consumption between treated
 and control households.
 We ran similar comparisons for the IVR intervention and the SMS intervention,
 but also failed to find any effect from these additional treatments.

I am already starting to doubt again on the comparison groups/hypotheses
 tested.
 The individual versus jointly comparison does not come out of these separate
 comparisons.
 We also do not compare eg.
 male only to female only + couple (female involved).
 Finally, maybe we should bring in the gender homophily hypothesis again,
 because our design allows for testing this, and no result is also a result...

 This is about 10 percent higher if the couple was targeted with the information.

 However, none of the differences remains significant after correcting for

 We find that within households where the video was shown to the male co-head
 only, 26

 As expected, if the video was only shown to the female co-head, significantly

 In other words, if men did not get the information, only about 12 percent

the man does

 Similarly, the knowledge gain

 Interestingly, we see that for almost all practices, the likelihood that
 the man decides alone decreases substantially if the video is shown to
 the woman alone or to the woman in addition to the man.
 For the decision to use fertilizer especially, the effect is large: while

n reduces to about 22 percent in the subgroup of households where the video
 was shown to the woman and about 26 percent in the subgroup of households
 where the video was shown to both spouses together.
 As such, if the information is also given to the female co-head instead
 of the the male co-head, the male co-head is less likely to make decisions
 related to the adoption of modern technologies and practices all by himself.

making of providing information to the couple is surprising, especially
 since in this subgroup, men report a reduction in decision making by themselves

 We did not find any significant effect of changing the messenger in the

 The results for the analysis of the messenger factor are reported in the

Adoption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous section, we have looked at the impact of the video interventions
 on who decides about agricultural technology adoption.
 Here, we go one step further and look at actual adoption of the practices
 and technologies recommended in the video at the individual level.
 In particular, we compare the proportion of plots between two treatments
 on which (i) the husband solely made the decision to implement the practice
 that is recommended in the video; (ii) the wife solely made the decision
 to implement the practice that is recommended in the video; and (iii) husband
 and wife indicate they jointly made the decision to implement a particular
 practice or input as recommended in the video
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that this is different from simply comparing adoption conditional on
 who made the decision.
 Such an analysis would suffer from selection bias, as the interventions
 also affect the decision making process.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Results are in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:M_adopt_ind_mm-1"

\end_inset

 for adoption by the male co-head individually, Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:M_adopt_ind_fm-1-1"

\end_inset

 for adoption by the female co-head individually and Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:R_adopt_ind_bm-1-1-1"

\end_inset

 for adoption by male and female co-heads jointly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:M_adopt_ind_mm-1"

\end_inset

 again reports averages for the households where the video was only shown
 to the male co-head.
 We see that, for example, on about 8.7 percent of plots the male co-head
 solely decided to start planting immediately after the first rains, as
 recommended in the video.
 Our video also stressed the importance of soil management and we find that
 on about 22 percent of maize plots the male co-head unilaterally decided
 to apply fertilizer.
 In the second column, we see that these averages are lower among households
 where the video was not shown to the man, but only to the female co-head.
 For example, in this group, we find that on only about 13 percent of plots
 the male co-head solely decided to use fertilizer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not surprisingly, Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:M_adopt_ind_fm-1-1"

\end_inset

 shows that adoption of recommended practices on female managed plots is
 very low.
 Showing the video to female co-heads significantly increases the likelihood
 of adoption of recommended practices as decided by the female, but also
 here, rates of adoption remain well below those of their informed male
 counterparts.
 For instance, women decide and use fertilizer on only 12.7 percent of plots
 if the woman was shown the video individually, as opposed to 22 percent
 of male adoption if the man is shown the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do find that actual adoption also depends on who gets the information.
 Impact is again strongest on male managed adoption.
 In particular, if the information is given to the female only instead of
 the man only, adoption by men reduces substantially.
 For instance, we see an almost 10 percentage points reduction in fertilizer
 use under male management.
 While showing the video to the couple also generally reduces male managed
 adoption rates, the results are less convincing than when we consider only
 decision making.

We also see that showing a video to the woman co-head instead of the male
 co-head increases adoption under female management.
 However, the increase is only significant after controlling for FWER for
 the strategy to reduce striga and for the use of commercial seed as opposed
 to recycled seed

 adoption of practices also increases, but mostly for practices that do

Finally, Table

 shows changes in adoption under joint management.
 There are some indications that joint adoption reduces when the video is
 shown to the woman alone as compared to when it is shown to the man alone.
 The fact that this effect was not present in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:dectechboth"

\end_inset

 suggests that there is still a big gap between decision making and adoption
 if the man is not informed.
 At the same time, we see that showing the video to a couple increases joint
 adoption.
 This effect, even though generally not significant after correcting for
 multiple hypothesis testing, is also less present in the corresponding
 table that only looks at decision making

Impact on production by plot manager
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:R_hh_prod-1"

\end_inset

 we look at how production outcomes are affected by our video intervention,
 also separately for male, female and jointly managed plots.
 The top panel in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:R_hh_prod-1"

\end_inset

 shows that a maize plot on average produces 137 kg under male management
 in households where the video was only shown to the male co-head.
 The average maize plot in a household where the male co-head was shown
 the video only produces 42 kg under the management of the female co-head
 (second panel), and the corresponding figure is about 90 kg under joint
 management.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that, on average, production under male management reduces by about
 26 kilos if the video was shown to the female co-head only.
 However, production under management of the female co-head increases dramatical
ly (36 percent).
 Plots under joint management produce the same amount regardless of who
 was shown the video.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On average, the area planted under male management is about 0.3 acres.
 Area planted under female management is three time lower.
 A further 0.22 acres is under joint management.
 We again see a reduction in area under male management if the women alone
 was shown the video and a corresponding increase in the area under female
 management, which was to be expected as we already saw that women increase
 decision making after receiving information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, we see that on an average one acre plot, about 200 kg is produced
 under male management, 70 kg under female management, and about 125 kg
 under joint management.
 If the video was shown to a female only, the amount produced per acre under
 male management reduces by 34 kg and the amount under female management
 increases by about 26 kg on the average one acre plot

In a world characterized by incomplete and asymmetric information, targeted
 efforts to fill knowledge gaps can make a big difference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 However, not every information campaign is equally effective, and often,
 seemingly small attributes, such as the way it is delivered, who is targeted
 by the message and who delivers the message, can result in significant
 differences in impact.
 Understanding and quantifying the importance of each of these design attributes
 through rigorous evaluation research should therefore be an essential part
 of any knowledge exchange model.

 In addition, and motivated by the observation that most agricultural

\begin_layout Standard
As a result of having been shown a video, households reduce the area under
 maize cultivation while producing the same amount, leading to a significant
 increase in maize yields, from 428 kg/acre to 488 kg/acre.
 Adding IVR further increases this to 526 kg/acre, but this is driven by
 an increase in production on the same area under cultivation.
 We find no effect from any intervention on self assessed well-being, nor
 on consumption expenditure.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the video is shown to the couple or the woman (as opposed to only the
 man), knowledge of the woman increases significantly, suggesting information
 does not flow from the man to the woman within the household.
 When the video was shown to couple (as opposed to only the man), women
 are more likely to speak up if they do not agree, and it is more likely
 that an agreement is reached.
 If women also receive the information, men are less likely to make adoption
 decisions unilaterally.
 If women also receive information, they will make significantly more decisions
 on the use of improved agronomic practices and inputs, but only if this
 information is not also available to the husband.
 Showing the video to both spouses jointly does seem to increase the likelihood
 of joint decision making for some practices, but none is significant after
 correcting for multiple comparisons.
 Finally, on an average plot of one acre, if the video was shown to a female
 only, the amount produced per acre under male management reduces by 34
 kg and the amount under female management increases by about 26 kg.
 We do not find that it matters if the information in the video was provided
 by a man, a woman, or a man and woman together.

note: The comparison group consists of households where the video was shown
 to the male co-head only.
 In the first column, means (and standard deviations) in the comparison
 group are presented for each variable.
 The second column reports differences (and standard errors of the differences)
 between the comparison group and each treatment group.
 Reported p-values are based on randomization inference (10,000 permutations);
 ***, ** and * denote difference is signficant at the 0.1, 1 and 5 percent
 level after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing using a family-wise
 sharp null (10,000 permutations).
 All specifications controls for the other orthogonal factors in the factorial
 design.
