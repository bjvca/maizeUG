\begin_layout Title
The Role of Gender in ICT-mediated Agricultural Information Campaigns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In agricultural information dissemination campaigns through agricultural
 advisory services, seemingly small design attributes, such as the way the
 information is delivered, who delivers the information, or who is targeted
 by the message, can result in significant differences in effectiveness
 and inclusiveness of the intervention.
 In the context of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) mediated
 knowledge transfer, this study investigates the importance of the gender
 composition of the person(s) who provide(s) the information and the gender
 composition of the person(s) who receive(s) the information.
 In particular, we set up a field experiment among smallholder maize farmers
 in Uganda to assess if reducing asymmetric information within the household
 leads to improved outcomes.
 In addition, we study the effectiveness of promoting a more cooperative
 approach to household farming.
 Finally, we test for gender homophily effects, where female farmers learn
 more from female trainers.
 Effectiveness is assessed in terms of knowledge gained, adoption of modern
 inputs and recommend practices, yield, and poverty reduction.
 Outcomes are dis-aggregated by gender to study changes in intra-household
 equity and women empowerment.
 While endline of the study is planned for February 2018, we preview encouraging
 effects on knowledge transfer as measured immediately after administering
 the treatments.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often, the poor make sub-optimal decision because they lack critical pieces
 of information, fail to notice 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "doi:10.1093/qje/qju015"

\end_inset

, or hold beliefs that are not true 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "doi:10.1162/qjec.2010.125.2.515,10.1257/app.3.1.1"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, in many instances, simple information campaigns designed to
 address these information inefficiencies can make a big difference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "banerjee2011poor"

\end_inset

.
 Also in the context of smallholder agriculture, it has been argued that
 a lack of information about the existence, use, and profitability of modern
 inputs and recommended practices is a major constraint to sustainable crop
 intensification 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jack2013market"

\end_inset

.
 This, together with new possibilities offered through innovations in Informatio
n and Communication Technologies (ICT) has led to several initiatives aimed
 at revitalizing agricultural advisory services in developing countries.
 However, it has also been found that not all information campaigns are
 equally effective and that seemingly small design attributes such as the
 way the information is delivered, who delivers the information and who
 was targeted can make a big difference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This research investigates gender related attributes that are thought to
 be key in effective and inclusive agricultural extension information delivery.
 In particular, we zoom in the the role of (i) the gender composition of
 the receiver(s) of the agricultural extension information messages and
 (ii) the gender composition of the messenger(s) of the information message.
 Together, particular combinations of these two attributes enable us to
 test three hypotheses.
 The first one is related to information asymmetries within the households,
 and we ask if it is more effective if both spouses within dual households
 have the same information then if only one of them has the information.
 The second hypothesis asserts that promoting a household cooperative approach
 to farming leads to better outcomes than when farming is framed as an idiosyncr
atic activity.
 Finally, a third hypothesis tests the existence of gender homophily in
 agricultural advisory services and investigates if information is more
 effective if comes from someone that is of the same gender.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The research hypotheses are answered through field experiments, where farmers
 are randomly assigned to a group that receives particular interventions,
 and their outcomes are compared to outcomes of a group of farmers that
 did not receive these particular interventions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2016field"

\end_inset

.
 As we want to test more than one research hypothesis and are particularly
 interested in comparing the relative effectiveness of various attributes
 of an ICT-mediated extension approach (instead of simply finding out what
 works and compare treatment to control groups), we opt for a factorial
 design.
 In such a design, farmers get a particular combination of interventions
 and, in general, a smaller sample size is needed to answer a fixed number
 of research questions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We work with maize farmers in eastern Uganda.
 The interventions take the form of short videos that explain simple yet
 effective ways to increase maize productivity, such as best practices in
 row spacing and soil fertility management.
 To test hypotheses related to the gender composition of the receivers,
 we show the video to either the man, the woman, or man and women as a couple
 within dual households.
 To test hypotheses related to the gender composition of the messenger(s),
 we produce different versions of the video.
 In one version of the video, the information is provided by a male farmer.
 In a second version of the video, the same information is provided by a
 woman farmer.
 Finally, in a third version of the video, the information is given by a
 couple.
 Power calculations suggest we need a sample of about 3,600 farmers, which
 was drawn from five districts.
 The videos were shown twice to farmers, once before the beginning of the
 main season, in July 2017, and once in the beginning of the season, in
 August 2017.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current version of this paper shows some initial results from this ongoing
 study.
 For instance, we have already established that the intervention is effective
 in transferring information: farmers that are shown a video are significantly
 more likely to select the correct answer from a set of alternative answers
 to a question.
 We also find that the information is more effective if the couple is targeted.
 An endline survey is planed in January 2018.
 As such, we will be able to assess if the interventions also affect adoption
 of modern technologies and recommended practice, which in turn are expected
 to increase yields and well-being.

Research Questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agricultural extension information services are generally biased toward
 men.
 Most often, extension officers are male who target the main decision maker
 with respect to agriculture within households, which is also often assumed
 to be the male farmer.
 The assumption that extension messages targeting one household member will
 trickle down to the rest of the household, including women and younger
 household members, may be false.
 Men do not necessarily discuss production decisions or transfer extension
 knowledge to women household members, especially if extension messages
 focus on menâ€™s priorities and crops 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fletschner2011gender"

\end_inset

.
 Gender homophily effects, where men learn more from other men and women
 learn more from other women, have also been documented in the context of
 agricultural extension services 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doss200127"

\end_inset

.
 At the same time, farms are essentially run and managed at the household
 level, and it may therefore be more effective if information is both provided
 and targeted at this level.
 The analysis of a Digital Green project in Ethiopia also concluded that
 there is much to be learned from observing the interactions between men
 and women who learn about the same technologies and practices

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we investigate the relative importance of (i) the gender
 composition of the messenger, and (ii) the gender composition of the audience
 for effective and inclusive agricultural extension information delivery
 to encourage sustainable crop intensification in smallholder household
 farms and for improving gender equity in household farming.
 By comparing groups of farmers where the messenger - recipient combinations
 differ, we can test a range of interesting hypotheses.
 In particular, our research is designed to answer the following research
 questions: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a first hypothesis, we will test if information is more effective if
 it is targeted to the couple within the household, instead of to an individual.
 It is related to the existence of asymmetric information within the household,
 which may lead to a sub-optimal intra-household allocation of productive
 resources and intensification investments.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "kabunga2012heterogeneous"

\end_inset

 find that female farmers are less likely to adopt tissue banana culture
 technology in Kenya, but that they would have an equal chance to adopt
 innovations, provided that they acquire sufficient knowledge about the
 innovation.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1093/erae/jbv039"

\end_inset

 investigate the effect of participating in extension training as a couple.
 They investigate whether participation of female farmers in an agricultural
 extension programme in South-Kivu increases adoption of three technologies:
 improved legume varieties, row planting and mineral fertilizer.
 In their study, joint male and female programme participation leads to
 the highest adoption rates.
 Knowledge may also affect technology adoption and subsequent yields through
 changes in relative bargaining power of the actors.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Doss200127"

\end_inset

 find that adoption of agricultural technologies among female farmers is
 lower than among male farmers.
 They find that this is due to gender-linked differences in access to complement
ary inputs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second hypothesis we will test is whether bringing the messages as a couple
 leads to better outcomes than when the information is given by an individual.
 This hypothesis is based on the assumption that social norms prevent women
 from playing a more prominent role in household agriculture.
 Gender stereotyping, where women are expected to tend to small gardens
 used to produce for home consumption and men are responsible for cash crops
 using inputs obtained from the market, may contribute to inefficient allocation
 of resources within the household as a single unit of production.
 Research on how information campaigns can be used to change beliefs, norms
 and perceptions has been ongoing in pubic health and has only recently
 started to trickle through to other disciplines.
 Encouraging results emerge with respect to the importance of role models

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a third hypothesis, we will test if matching the gender of the recipient
 with the gender of the messenger leads to better outcomes.
 Homophily effects often encountered in social sciences presume people learn
 more from people they can relate to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.415"

 In Mozambique, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:78:y:2016:i:c:p:436-449"

\end_inset

 find evidence of such a gender-matching or homophily effect in extension,
 whereby women seem to learn more from fellow women and men seem to learn
 more from fellow men.
 In particular, they find that among men who received information about
 pit planting from a male messenger, the proportion that are aware of pit
 planting is 10 percentage points higher.
 Female awareness, knowledge and adoption is the same irrespective of the
 presence of a male extension worker.
 However, if a female extension worker is added, awareness, knowledge and
 adoption among female farmers also increases by roughly the same proportions.

Experimental Design and Corresponding Sampling Frame
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment was implemented as 3 by 2 factorial design to which a control
 group was added.
 We define two different factors, each with three levels.
 The first factor corresponds to the person(s) who provide the message and
 has three levels (male, female and couple).
 Similarly, the second factor corresponds to the person who receives the
 information message.
 This factor also has three levels (male, female and couple).
 A separate control group receives no information.
 The design is illustrated in Figure

The design in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 allows us to test all the hypotheses outlined above, in addition to simply
 testing if our information intervention works.
 To test if the information campaign works, we simply compare the average
 outcome among farmers in the control group to the average outcome of farmers
 that received the information intervention, irrespective of who received
 the information and who provided the information.
 This is illustrated in Panel (A) of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypothesis-tests"

\end_inset

.
 To test if information is more effective if it is targeted to the couple
 instead of the individual within the household (and hence test the asymmetric
 information hypotheses), we compare households where the couple received
 the information (irrespective of who provided the information) to households
 where the information was given to an individual (again irrespective of
 who provided the information).
 This is shown in Panel (B) of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypothesis-tests"

\end_inset

.
 To test if projecting a household cooperative approach is more effective,
 we compare outcomes of farmers where the information was provided by a
 couple of farmers, irrespective of who within the household received the
 information, to outcomes of farmers where the information was provided
 by a single farmer, again irrespective of who received the information
 (Panel (C) in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypothesis-tests"

\end_inset

).
 Finally, the gender homophily hypothesis can be tested by comparing outcomes
 of farmers where the information was provided by a woman to a woman in
 the household and information was provided by a man to a man to outcome
 of farmers where the messenger was a man and the recipient was a woman
 and farmers where the messenger was a woman and the recipient was a man

The sample size and its distribution over different treatment combinations
 was based on an elaborate series of power calculations.
 Instead of determining power analytically, we used simulation techniques.
 Simulation allows us to sample from actual data on outcome variables instead
 of from a theoretical distribution with an assumed mean and standard deviation,
 which is a much more intuitive way to think about statistical power.
 It is straightforward to build in flexibility, such as allowing for more
 than one treatment arm, or account for sampling design effects such as
 cluster sampling.
 Power calculations were based on two outcome variables, one that reflects
 efficiency at the household level (maize yield) and one that reflects inclusive
ness (the gender productivity gap, where women managed plots are farmed
 less extensively than male managed plots resulting in significantly lower
 yields), and sample size was determined for each of the three hypotheses
 above (plus the treatment versus control).
 As can be seen, the gender homophily hypothesis is the most stringent,
 as it is based on only 4 cells of the design in Figure

Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We ran the experiment among maize farmer in Uganda.
 Maize is widely consumed, yet its value to weight ratio is sufficiently
 high to also make it an important traded commodity.
 Therefore, increasing maize productivity at the farm household level has
 the potential to lead to improvements in both nutritional outcomes and
 income.
 Maize yields in Uganda are relatively low.
 While on-station trials report potential yields average about 1.6 metric
 tons per acre (improved varieties, no fertilizer used), according to Uganda
 National Household Survey 2005/06 data, average maize yields are much lower,
 at about 618 kg per acre for the main growing season of 2014.
 There is a lot of variation in yields, with the top 10 percent of best
 farmers getting yields in excess of 1.1 metric tons per acre.
 At the same time, the use of modern inputs such as inorganic fertilizer
 and modern technologies such as row planting is very low in Uganda.
 For example, use of inorganic fertilizer averages only 1 kg of nutrient
 per hectare per year, compared to Kenya (32 kg/ha); Rwanda (29 kg/ha);
 and Tanzania (6 kg/ha).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maize is especially important in the East.
 We will sample from five districts from the East known for their maize
 production: Bugiri, Mayuge, Iganga, Namayingo and Namutumba.

 gives an idea of how villages are distributed over parishes, which are
 in turn allocated to sub-counties within each of the 5 districts in our
 study.
 From this, we removed town councils and also two sub-counties that consisted
 of islands in lake Victoria.

In particular, given the subject of our study, we target monogamous dual
 households that are growing maize.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Because of cost considerations, however, we will use two-stage cluster
 sampling to obtain a representative sample of this population.
 In particular, we will first randomly select parishes (proportional to
 the number of villages within each parish).
 In the selected parishes, all villages will be included in the study.
 Within each village, we will then list all the households, from which we
 will then sample households to be included in the study.
 At the same time, we suspect that outcomes within villages will be correlated,
 for instance due to local weather conditions, or development programs that
 are implemented in certain areas.
 We therefore use the village as a blocking factor.
 In other words, in each village, we will makes sure all possible treatment
 combinations related to the 2 factors (plus control) are administered.
 From the research strategy above, we learn that the messenger and the recipient
 factor combine into 9 different treatment combinations.
 Adding the control leads to 10 different households being selected in each
 village.

Calendar
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the East, there are two maize cropping seasons.
 For our study, we will concentrate on the second maize growing season,
 which runs from about August to January.
 In August, fields are prepared and planting is don in September.
 First weeding happens around the end of September or the beginning of October.
 By late October, a second round of weeding takes place as maize starts
 to flower.
 Mid to late December, harvesting starts.
 In higher areas, harvesting can go on until mid January.
 During the second season, farmers prefer early maturing varieties, as the
 rains are short.
 However, in general, early maturing varieties have lower yields.
 The full cycle from planting to harvesting in lowland areas takes about
 3 to 3.5 months.
 In high altitude areas this can take up to 5 months.
 In our study, we will concentrate on lowland areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Barriers to maize intensification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The treatments consist of the provision of information that is assumed to
 increase maize productivity through encouraging adoption of modern technologies
 and recommended practices.
 The goal was to select those practices and technologies that are likely
 to have the largest impact on yield, household income and intra-household
 equity.
 The topics to be included in the video script were obtained from interviews
 with key stakeholder and experts, such as maize farmers, value chain actors,
 maize breeders, extension workers and other government staff such as the
 district agricultural officer.
 These interviews took place in May 2017.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main factors affecting maize productivity are related to pests, poor
 soils, and poor seed quality.
 The three most important 
\series bold
pests
\series default
 that affect maize farming are Striga, maize stalk borer, and now also Armyworm.
 Striga (in particular the Striga hermonihica variety), also called whichweed,
 is a parasitic plant that feeds off the roots of maize.
 Doing so, it starts to draw nutrients from the host, leading to severe
 stunting of the host crop.
 Since most of the damage is already done by the time the parasite emerges
 from the ground, weeding is not very effective.
 In addition, each Striga plant produces up to 50,000 seeds, which remain
 dormant in the soil until new maize is planted.
 Striga can reduce production from about 30 percent up to total loss of
 the crop.
 No single method is effective to control striga.
 A new hybird seed called Longe 7 HR, boosted with a herbicide, is said
 to be less affected by striga, but it is expensive at 10,000 UGX/kg and
 does poorly under dry conditions and in areas where the rains are short
 such as in the East
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the East, early maturing varieties are preferred, such as Longe 10.
 In the future, it a similar HR strain of Longe 10 is expected to be released.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Crop rotation with sweet potato or beans can reduce stiga infestation.
 Furthermore, (additional) inorganic fertilizer use has also been recommended
 to counter stiga.
 It has been observed that stiga proliferates when soils are poor.
 In addition, one can make up for the nutrients drained by the parasite
 by boosting the maize plant with DAP or NPK.
 Weeding, especially the first time the stiga comes up before it has had
 the chance to dig into the roots of the maize, is recommended, also to
 reduce the spread of seeds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stemborer is actually a moth that is active during night, laying eggs
 on maize plants.
 It is the larva of the moths that cause the damage.
 They enter inside maize stem, where they feed and grow for about three
 weeks.
 If larvae enter the maize plant at an early stage, this can kill the plant.
 At a later stage, since larvae make extensive tunnels inside the stem,
 the maize plants weaken.
 The stem may break, or the maize plants may fall over.
 Maize stemborer can reduce production by between 20 and 40 percent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fall armyworm is relatively new in Uganda
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Armyworm was discovered in Uganda in the first season of 2017.
 However, experts told us that it was also present in the second season
 of 2016 but was mistaken for stemborer.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As the stemborer, the damage is done by a larva from a moth.
 Currently, it is present in about 20 districts.
 In some districts, up to 40 percent of maize is affected.
 Yield losses are estimated at 10 to 15 percent nationwide.
 However, experts fear this is only the beginning, and armyworm may overtake
 stemborer as the most destructive pest.
 Armyworm is very difficult to control.
 One expert had some success with a chemical called Dudu Accelamectin, which
 required spraying only once and hence is cheap.
 However, other experts warned that the effectiveness of one single type
 of chemical depends on many factors such as location, type of seed used,
 etc.
 Other chemicals such as Rocket were also mentioned to be somewhat effective.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Poor soils
\series default
, exhausted by continuous cultivation with little rotation, is a second
 main limiting factor.
 Soils lack macro-nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium
 (K).
 Farmers rarely use organic fertilizer.
 Experts say it is virtually impossible to get decent yields without using
 inorganic fertilizer.
 In particular, at planting stage, DAP or NPK should be used in the soil.
 After about 4 weeks, a nitrogen based fertilizer such as Urea should be
 applied on the topsoil near the plants to boost vegetation.
 Sometimes it is also advised to split the application of urea, administering
 half a doze at 4 weeks and half a dose at tasseling stage.
 Fertilizer can easily double yields.
 Especially used in combination with improved seeds, the effects of fertilizer
 are significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within Africa, farmers mainly rely on saved 
\series bold
seeds
\series default
, and maize in Eastern Uganda is no exception 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 However, as maize is cross pollinated, recycling leads to fast degeneration.
 However, hybrid seeds such as Longe 7, Longe 9 are available and have also
 been distributed through Operation Wealth Creation.
 Hybird seeds potentially triple yields.
 In addition to hybrid seeds, which need to be procured every seasons as
 they can not be recycled, the government also released Open Pollinated
 Varieties (OPV).
 These are improved varieties that can be reused for about 3 or 4 seasons.
 In general, they are lower yielding than hybrid seeds.
 Still, yield are likely to be about 30 to 40 percent higher than when saved
 seeds are used, up to 100 percent if OPVs are also used with fertilizer.
 OPVs are generally recommended to poorer farmers as they can be reused
 as seeds to some extent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most hybrid seeds take long to mature.
 Farmers also complain that hybrids do not withstand drought very well.
 However, new varieties have entered the market that are both high yielding
 and early maturing.
 For example, UH5354, marketed as Bazooka yields about 20 percent more than
 other hybirds and is drought resistant.
 Farmers that use these seeds report up to 40 bags of maize per acre.
 Today, yields are about 7-8 bags per acre.
 Similarly, there are several OPVs on the market that are also early maturing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, there are also 
\series bold
agricultural practices
\series default
 that affect yields, but the effects are generally smaller than those related
 to improved seeds and inorganic fertilizer use.
 The most important are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Timely planting
\series default
: maize should be planted at the onset of the rains.
 However, many farmers delay planting for several reasons.
 For instance, they may not be certain that the rains have really started.
 There may also be bottlenecks in land preparation, where the poor are often
 the last in line for the use of oxen or tractors.
 It is estimated that each day a farmer delays planting, yields reduce by
 1.5 percent.

\series bold
Plant spacing
\series default
: Plant that are too close to each other compete for light and nutrients,
 reducing yields.
 Plants that are to far from each other means space is wasted, also leading
 to lower yields.
 Related is the number of seeds that farmer plant in each hill.
 The recommended practice is to put in two, but farmers want to be sure
 of germination and put in more, sometimes up to 5.
 If they all germinate, there is competition for nutrients and sun.
 Usually there is also not enough thinning, or this is done too late when
 competition has already occurred.
 One expert told us that standard spacing is 75cm x 60cm with two plants
 per hill.
 However, they now recommend 75cm x 30cm with 1 plant per hill.
 The expert estimated the latter results in a 35 percent higher yield than
 the former.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Weeding
\series default
: The first weeding should be at 18-20 days after planting at the three
 leaf stage, and the second weeding at 2-3 weeks after first weeding.
 From emergence to 8 leaves (knee height), maize plant is a very poor competitor
 and unwanted stress such as weed competition must be prevented.
 Weeding must therefore be done within that period.
 A third weeding is optional.
 It is only dependent on weed pressure after the second weed.
 If needed, it should be done at tasseling stage.
 Weeding removing Striga at early stage before it can attach to the roots
 of the maize can also have a significant impact on yields.
 In addition, removing striga before it flowers reduces the spread of the
 pest.
 Proper weeding can increase yield by about 50 to 70 percent.

As mentioned above, pest control also ranks high among technologies that
 increase yields.
 However, we felt uncomfortable promoting chemicals in our videos that are
 potentially hazardous to humans.
 In Uganda, Endosulfan, DDT, Glyphosate, Linden and othersâ€”are still being
 used.
 Many of these are on the World Health Organizationâ€™s list of banned chemicals

 From our conversations with experts, we learn that many farmers may already
 be aware of the existence and use of these technologies or practices.
 Therefore, simply providing information about the existence of modern technolog
ies and recommended practices and on how to uses them may not be sufficient
 to change behavior.
 Often, access and affordability was mentioned as a problem

Farmers indeed often mention they do not use modern inputs because they
 have no money, suggesting liquidity is the main constraining factor, and
 thus instead of providing information, a more effective strategy would
 be to provide credit or subsidize inputs.
 Recent research, however, finds that despite what farmers claim, liquidity
 is often not the most important constraining factor.

The fact that farmers do not engage in a cost benefit analysis, where inputs
 are used to generate output, was illustrated by a complaint made by one
 of the farmers.
 He complained that farmers get low prices.
 To him, it did not make sense to buy seed at 6000 per kg and sell maize
 at only 300-400 per kg.

 In addition, we will encourage farmers to start small, using fertilizer
 and seeds on a small area of their field to experiment and see for themselves,
 and reinvest in subsequent years.

 uncertain outcomes in a distant future, is often challenging for poorly

 We also pay considerable attention to the way the message is delivered.
 For instance, the message if brought by

\begin_layout Standard
The video starts with a farmer (a male farmer, a female farmer, or a couple,
 see below) introducing themselves.
 He talks about how he used to struggle with his maize gardens and how at
 one point in time, he decided things needed to change.
 It is shown how the farmer sells a hen, and obtains a small loan from a
 friend.
 This money is than used to buy small quantities of improved seed and fertilizer
 in a local shop.
 It is then shown that, before planting the improved seed, the farmer prepares
 the garden.
 He is shown collecting manure wherever he can find it, and applies it to
 a small corner of the field of 20m by 20m.
 Next, it is shown in detail how the maize seeds are spaced 75cm x 30cm
 with 1 plant per hill and how the DAP should be applied.
 The viewer is reminded to plant in time.
 The next scene depicts the field after about 10 to 12 days when the maize
 has emerged from the ground.
 At this stage, it is recommended that the farmer engages into gap filling
 to replace seeds that did not germinate with new seeds to preserve optimal
 plant density.
 The next shot shows the field at 18 to 20 days after planing, when first
 weeding is done.
 Particular attention is paid to identification of striga in an early stage.
 It is also advised to weed again two to three weeks later.
 The next scene zooms in on urea fertilizer application.
 Here, the field is shown at about 4 weeks after planting when the maize
 is knee high.
 It is shown how Urea topsoil dressing should be applied.
 Finally, it is recommended to do one more round of weeding around the tasseling
 stage of the maize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then spend some time comparing the costs to the benefits the different
 improved inputs and recommended practices.
 For fertilizer and improved seed, the costs for one acre is calculated
 and compared to the value of what is harvested.
 The profit is then compared to the value of what would have been harvested
 on that acre without improved seed and fertilizer.
 This would be less than half of what the profit would be when improved
 inputs are used.
 For recommended practices, we report what the expected yield increase would
 be if, for instance, recommended spacing was used or weeding is done in
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we try to promote a long run perspective, where the farmer is encouraged
 to start small (one tenth of an acre) and grow bigger over time.
 We also pay some attention to the commitment problem.
 We advise the farmer to, at time of harvest when the farmer sells most
 of his maize, immediately go to the farm supply store and purchase seeds
 and fertilizer, and store this in a safe place.
 If inputs are not available, farmers are encouraged to keep the money needed
 to buy the inputs in a separate, labeled container.
 It is sometimes argued that such mental accounting can be an effective
 commitment mechanism

A total of three such videos will be produced.
 They will be identical in terms of the information that will be in the

 In one version of the video, the actor will be a man.
 In a second version of the video, the actor will be female.
 In a third version, the video will feature a couple as the messenger.
 Here, both male and female will feature in the different scenes, and the
 person talking to the viewer will be altered between the man and the women.
 Finally, we will use a placebo video for the control.
 This will be a neutral video on a non-related topic, such as the tourist
 potential of the region.
 Farmers will be shown any of these four videos according to random treatment
 allocation.
 Videos will be shown twice to each farmer in the sample, once before planing
 (July) and once immediately after planting (August).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The videos will be embedded in a small Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing
 (CAPI) survey application implemented in Open Data Kit (ODK).
 The application will start by asking some identifying information about
 the farmer and recording consent.
 It will also be used to collect some basic farmer characteristics, which
 can be used to investigate balance at baseline (see the section on balance
 below).
 The application will also embed the video, which will be cued to make sure
 the correct video is shown to the right farmer.
 Finally, information will be gathered on viewing conditions, and some informati

 given in the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The IVR system consists of a toll free number that can be called by the
 farmer.
 Farmers that are assigned to this treatment will be given the toll free
 number and leaflet that provides some more information about the system.
 When calling the IVR system, the caller is greeted in Lusoga and a tutorial
 is provided within the system.
 The caller is presented with a menu and can choose to learn more about
 different aspects of maize farming, such as soil management, seed selection,
 pests and diseases, post harvest practices,...
 After selecting the desired option, the farmer hears a conversation between
 two farmers, where one farmer explains recommended practices to another
 farmer.
 While the IVR system has more information that the videos, we made sure
 that the information that we provide in the videos is the same as what
 is provided in the IVR system.
 The SMS messages that will be sent out to half of the farmers that are
 assigned the IVR treatment will simply be a reminder of the existence of
 the service and the phone number they can dial to access it.

\begin_layout Standard
While we did not do a dedicated baseline survey, we did ask some questions
 before the first intervention to investigate balance.
 The choice of variables was based on what variables other researchers in
 similar studies use in their orthogonality tests.
 In particular, we looked at balance tables in studies that investigate
 the adoption of yield improving methods and technologies using RCTs.
 These studies include

.
 In addition, we also add some variables that may be useful to investigate
 heterogeneity in treatment effects.
 In particular, we collect some household characteristics such as household
 size, age and education level of both wife and husband.
 We then ask more specific questions related to maize farming, such as acreage
 and quantities produced in the last season.
 Furthermore, we ask if the household received agricultural extension, whether
 improved maize seeds were used, and whether fertilizer was applied.
 We also collect data on housing conditions (material of wall and number
 of bedrooms) and access to off-farm income.
 In Table

The table shows that few farmers that were included in our study had access
 to agricultural extension in the previous year.
 We also see that only about 20 percent of farmers reported to have used
 fertilizer in the previous maize growing season (April â€“ July 2017) and
 about 38 percent reported to have use improved seed bought from a shop
 or agro-input dealer during the last cropping season.
 This suggests ample scope to increase intensification investment through
 extension.
 We also find that farmers produced on average only 287 kg of maize per
 acre in the first cropping season of 2017.
 This is substantially lower than the average yield of 618 kg per acre we
 find when using the Uganda National Household Survey of 2005/06.
 The low yields illustrate the devastating impact of the fall armyworm that
 ravaged maize yields in East Africa in 2017

The table also shows some imbalance, particularly with respect to the asymmetric
 information hypothesis, where farmers that were shown the video individually
 are compared to farmers that received the information treatment as a couple.
 In particular, we find that households where the information was shown
 to couple were significantly younger, and this difference is also reflected
 in other variables.
 For instance, the fact that they are younger apparently also means they
 have fewer children, are more likely to have used fertilizer in the previous
 growing season and are less likely to have finished primary education.
 This imbalance may be a due to the design of our experiment.
 More precisely, for this particular hypothesis, we need to treat a couple,
 and the likelihood that a couple can be found reduces with age, as one
 of the spouses may die or they may get divorced.

Intent to Treat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the research questions related to gender composition of messenger and
 recipient, we assume full compliance, and as such assume that the average
 treatment effect (or Intention tot Treat effect) is equal to the Treatment
 of the Treated effect.
 Therefor, we will simply compare means between the different groups in
 a regression framework.
 In particular, we identify the treatment effects 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 by estimating the average treatment effect of an outcome variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{h}=\alpha+\beta T_{h}+\varepsilon_{h}\label{eq:ate}

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is an indicator function that is one if household 
\emph on
h
\emph default
 was in the treatment group and zero otherwise.
 We will control for the gender of the enumerator and also add parish fixed
 effects.
 In addition, in a factorial design, orthogonal treatments are likely to
 increase the variance of the outcome variable.
 As such, we also need to control for the treatment status of the other
 factors (and add dummies for, for instance IVR and IVR+sms).
 For the treatments where compliance can not be completely controlled, we
 also control for ex post outcomes derived from the endline survey (eg.
 an indicator if the man used IVR, an indicator if the woman used IVR,...).
 For the few outcome variables that are also collected at baseline such
 as fertilizer use or use of improved seed (see balancing checks above),
 difference-in-difference models will be estimated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to realize that treatment and control groups need to be
 balanced over all other factors.
 This means that often, we can not use all observations.
 For example, if we want to simply test if being shown any video was effective
 in increasing maize yields, we can not simply compare the 257 control household
s that were shown a video to all households that were shown a video (3,331
 households).
 We need to make sure that within the treatment group, there are equal numbers
 in each cell.
 As such, we need to take the treatment combination with the least observations,
 which are according to the power calculations the combinations where the
 video is shown to the couple and the messenger is either a man or a women
 (BM and BF).
 In these cells, we need at least 342 observations.
 Therefore, to test the effectiveness of videos, we compare 257 control
 households to 3,078 households, which corresponds to 342 households in
 each of 9 treatment combination cells.
 Therefore, in each cell that has excess observations, we will take a random
 sample.
 For example, according to the power calculations, we will have 385 households
 in the treatment combination where the messenger is male and the recipient
 is male (MM).
 We will take a random sample of 342 from these 385 households.

In a world characterized by incomplete and asymmetric information, targeted
 efforts to fill knowledge gaps can make a big difference

.
 However, not every information campaign is equally effective, and often,
 seemingly small attributes, such as the way a message is framed, how it
 is delivered, who is targeted by the message and who delivers the message,
 can result in significant differences in impact.
 Understanding and quantifying the importance of each of these design attributes
 through rigorous evaluation research should therefore be an essential part
 of any knowledge exchange model.
