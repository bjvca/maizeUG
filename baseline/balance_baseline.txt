Baseline questionnaire:

This is the questionnaire that will be used when the videos are shown for the first time. The idea is to collect a limited number of variables which can be used to assess balance between the various treatment groups. In addition, some variables may be useful to investigate heterogeneity in treatment effects. The survey is implemented in ODK. It will have household identifiers prepopulated, and conditional on what treatment the household should receive, the right questions will appear and the correct video will be cued. The video will be embedded into he survey.
