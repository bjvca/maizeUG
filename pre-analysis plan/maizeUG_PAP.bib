  Abstract                 = {Why do men and women adopt agricultural technologies at different rates? Evidence from Ghana suggests that gender-linked differences in the adoption of modern maize varieties and chemical fertilizer result from gender-linked differences in access to complementary inputs. This finding has important policy implications, because it suggests that ensuring more widespread and equitable adoption of improved technologies may not require changes in the research system, but rather introduction of measures that ensure better access for women to complementary inputs, especially land, labor, and extension services. },

  Abstract                 = {Agricultural innovation is essential to meet the food requirements of Africa’s growing population. One pathway to increasing yields may be to enhance female farmer productivity. In many settings, married women cultivate plots separated from those of other family members. They face different challenges to productivity, such as deficiencies in inputs, weak property rights, and time constraints. It has long been argued that traditionally male-dominated extension services may also contribute to a gender bias in adoption of new agricultural techniques. If this is true, placing women in extension positions may help other women overcome barriers to adoption posed by inequitable access to agricultural extension services or exposure to inapt information. To better understand the role of gender in the dissemination of sustainable land management (SLM) techniques, this study uses a randomized policy experiment conducted in 200 communities in Mozambique. We examine the impact of training female messengers of SLM techniques on the awareness, knowledge, and adoption of SLM practices by other female farmers. Communities were randomly selected in 2010 to have a female messenger trained in SLM who was encouraged to teach other women the techniques. Using data from panel surveys collected in the experimental areas, we find women’s awareness of pit planting farming techniques increased by 9 percentage points in 2012 and adoption of the technology by 5 percentage points in 2013 in communities with female messengers.},

  Abstract                 = {Seed can be an important entry point for promoting productivity, nutrition and resilience among smallholder farmers. While investments have primarily focused on strengthening the formal sector, this article documents the degree to which the informal sector remains the core for seed acquisition, especially in Africa. Conclusions drawn from a uniquely comprehensive data set, 9660 observations across six countries and covering 40 crops, show that farmers access 90.2 {\%} of their seed from informal systems with 50.9 {\%} of that deriving from local markets. Further, 55 {\%} of seed is paid for by cash, indicating that smallholders are already making important investments in this arena. Targeted interventions are proposed for rendering formal and informal seed sector more smallholder-responsive and for scaling up positive impacts.},
